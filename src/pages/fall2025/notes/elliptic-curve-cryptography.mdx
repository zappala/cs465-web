## Questions on the readings

The reading today is
[A (Relatively Easy To Understand) Primer on Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/).

## RSA

- The computational security of RSA depends on a _trapdoor function_, meaning a
  function that is easy to compute in one direction but computationally
  infeasible in the other direction.

- RSA parameters
  - m: message
  - e: public exponent
  - d: private exponent
  - n: modulus
  - c: ciphertext
- RSA encryption, in simplified form, is c = m<sup>e</sup> (mod n)
- RSA decryption, in simplified form, is m = c<sup>d</sup> (mod n)

- Process to choose a public and private key

  - The receiver chooses two large prime numbers, _p_, and _q_. Compute their
    product, _n = pq_.
  - The receiver calculates _ϕ(pq) = (p - 1)(q - 1)_.
  - The receiver chooses a number _e_ relatively prime to _ϕ(pq)_. In practice,
    _e_ may be 2<sup>16</sup> +1 = 65537.
  - The public key is _(e, n)_.
  - The receiver calculates the modular inverse _d_ of _e modulo ϕ(n)_. This
    means _de = 1 (mod ϕ(n))_.
  - The private key is _d_.

- Attacking RSA
  - Attacker knows _n_, but factoring into _p_ and _q_ is a known hard problem.
  - Attacker does not know _ϕ(n)_, so it cannot use knowledge of _e_ to
    calculate _d_. The only way to get _ϕ(n)_ is to factor _n_ into its primes.

## Elliptic curve cryptography

- elliptic curves provide a better trapdoor function
- curves have a form similar to y = x<sup>3</sup> + ax + b

- _An elliptic curve cryptosystem can be defined by picking a prime number as a
  maximum, a curve equation and a public point on the curve. A private key is a
  number priv, and a public key is the public point dotted with itself priv
  times. Computing the private key from the public key in this kind of
  cryptosystem is called the elliptic curve discrete logarithm function. This
  turns out to be the Trapdoor Function we were looking for._

- elliptic curves are much more efficient for the same level of security

| RSA key size (bits) | ECC key size (bits) |

| 1024                | 160                 |
| 2048                | 224                 |
| 3072                | 256                 |
| 7680                | 384                 |
