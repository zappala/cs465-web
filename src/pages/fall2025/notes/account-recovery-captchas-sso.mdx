## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 3](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)

## Account recovery

**_Never_ store passwords in the clear so that you can offer "password
recovery"**

- recovery link or code sent via email

  - must inclue some randomized code in the link to avoid replay attacks
  - difficulty: compromised email account can be used to take over other
    accounts

- one-time code sent via SMS
  - difficulty: phones subject to targeted SIM cloning attacks
- challenge questions
  - difficulty: users may forget answers, answers may be easily guessed, likely
    stored in plaintext so can be leaked
  - not recommended

## CAPTCHA

- used to prevent mass creation of free accounts, spam on discussion boards
- often based on character recognition, audio recognition, image recognition, or
  cognitive games
- can use as an alternative to rate limiting
- susceptible to AI, human labor pools
- reCAPTCHA ("I am not a robot") measures human interaction with the webpage

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

- uses an identity provider to issue access tokens for an account held at a
  relying party
- centralized login, but also concentrated risk

- types of systems

  - credential manager (including password managers)
  - enterprise SSO -- typically used in a corporate environment, e.g. Kerberos,
    Central Authentication Services (CAS)
  - Federated Identity -- e.g. OAuth2, Kerberos

### OAUTH2

<Image alt="abstract picture of OAUTH2 authorization flow" src={rfc6749_figure_1} />

- when logging into a relying party (website), redirected to identity provider
- user authenticates to identity provider, given a token, and redirected back to
  original relying party
- relying party accepts token from identity provider as authenticating the user

<Image alt="more detailed OAUTH2 authorization flow" src={oauth_authorization_authlete2017} />

- complex authentication flow, so easy for websites to make mistakes (see extra
  reading)

### Kerberos

- uses a centralized key distribution center (KDC), called T
- enables mutual authentication between client A and server B

  - A authenticates to ticket server T, receives an encrypted ticket it can give
    to B, plus a secret key for communicating with B, k<sub>s</sub>. The ticket
    contains the secret key, but encrypted for B.
  - A can now give the ticket to B, plus prove that it knows the secret key
    k<sub>s</sub>
  - B then authenticates to A that it knows the secret key k<sub>s</sub>

- this is a simplified version of Kerberos, there are _many_ more details

  [Email as a Master Key: Analyzing Account Recovery in the Wild](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8486017),
  Li, Wang, and Sun, IEEE INFOCOM 2018

_Account recovery (usually through a password reset) on many websites has mainly
relied on accessibility to a registered email due to its favorable deployability
and usability. However, it makes a user’s online accounts vulnerable to a single
point of failure when the registered email account is compromised. While
previous research focuses on strengthening user passwords, the security risk
imposed by email-based account recovery has not yet been well studied. In this
paper, we investigate the possibility of mounting an email-based account
recovery attack. Specifically, we examine the account authentication and
recovery protocols in 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming that most of them
use emails for account recovery. We further scrutinize the security policy of
major email service providers and show that a significant portion of them take
no or marginal effort to protect user email accounts, leaving compromised email
accounts readily available for mounting account recovery attacks. Then, we
conduct case studies to assess potential losses caused by such attacks. Finally,
we propose a lightweight email security enhancement called Secure Email Account
Recovery (SEAR) to defend against account recovery attacks as an extra layer of
protection to account recovery emails._

  [Secrets, Lies, and Account Recovery: Lessons from the Use of Personal Knowledge Questions at Google](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2736277.2741691)

_We examine the first large real-world data set on personal knowledge question's
security and memorability from their deployment at Google. Our analysis confirms
that secret questions generally offer a security level that is far lower than
user-chosen passwords. It turns out to be even lower than proxies such as the
real distribution of surnames in the population would indicate. Surprisingly, we
found that a significant cause of this insecurity is that users often don't
answer truthfully. A user survey we conducted revealed that a significant
fraction of users (37%) who admitted to providing fake answers did so in an
attempt to make them "harder to guess" although on aggregate this behavior had
the opposite effect as people "harden" their answers in the same and predictable
way. On the usability side, we show that secret answers have surprisingly poor
memorability despite the assumption that their reliability motivates their
continued deployment. From millions of account recovery attempts we observed a
significant fraction of users (e.g 40% of our English-speaking US users) were
unable to recall their answers when needed. This is lower than the success rate
of alternative recovery mechanisms such as SMS reset codes (over 80%). Comparing
question strength and memorability reveals that the questions that are
potentially the most secure (e.g what is your first phone number) are also the
ones with the worst memorability. We conclude that it appears next to impossible
to find secret questions that are both secure and memorable. Secret questions
continue have some use when combined with other signals, but they should not be
used alone and best practice should favor more reliable alternatives._

### CAPTCHA

  [Gotta CAPTCHA 'Em All: A Survey of 20 Years of the Human-or-computer Dilemma](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3477142),
  Guerar, Verdarame, Migliardi, Palmieri, Merlo, ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR),
  2021

_A recent study has found that malicious bots generated nearly a quarter of
overall website traffic in 2019. These malicious bots perform activities such as
price and content scraping, account creation and takeover, credit card fraud,
denial of service, and so on. Thus, they represent a serious threat to all
businesses in general, but are especially troublesome for e-commerce, travel,
and financial services. One of the most common defense mechanisms against bots
abusing online services is the introduction of Completely Automated Public
Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), so it is extremely
important to understand which CAPTCHA schemes have been designed and their
actual effectiveness against the ever-evolving bots. To this end, this work
provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field of CAPTCHA
schemes and defines a new classification that includes all the emerging schemes.
In addition, for each identified CAPTCHA category, the most successful attack
methods are summarized by also describing how CAPTCHA schemes evolved to resist
bot attacks, and discussing the limitations of different CAPTCHA schemes from
the security, usability, and compatibility point of view. Finally, an assessment
of the open issues, challenges, and opportunities for further study is provided,
paving the road toward the design of the next-generation secure and
user-friendly CAPTCHA schemes._

### OAUTH2

  [Towards Automated Auditing for Account and Session Management Flaws in Single Sign-On Deployments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833753),
  Ghasemisharif, Kanich, and Polakis, IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, 2022

_Single Sign-On (SSO) is both a core and critical component of user
authentication and authorization on the modern web, as it is often offered by
web and mobile applications alongside credentia-based authentication to
facilitate the account creation and login process. However, the interplay
between local account management and SSO functionality in the backend leads to
flaws that enable or magnify account hijacking attacks. These flaws are not
baked into the actual SSO protocols, but manifest due to the complexity of
supporting separate but intermingling authentication paths. As a result, these
types of flaws cannot be detected by the SSO protocol or implementation
verification tools proposed in prior work. In this paper we introduce SAAT, a
fully automated modular framework that assesses whether relying parties (RPs)
that use Facebook as the IdP comply with secure practices and guidelines, and
uncovers flaws in account and session management that stem from or are affected
by the interplay of SSO and local functionality. We conduct a large-scale
exploration of authentication and session practices in Facebook’s RPs, revealing
a volatile ecosystem where SSO support can be suddenly dropped and 17.6% of the
tested RPs exhibit non-functional SSO implementations. This highlights the need
for the continuous and systematic testing of the SSO ecosystem made possible by
SAAT. More critically, we find that security measures are often missing and
official guidelines are routinely overlooked or misconfigured, with only 0.8% of
the RPs fully enabling re-authentication which can prevent compromise from
hijacked identity provider (IdP) cookies. Our study also shows that less than 2%
of RPs correctly react to SSO revocation and 67% continue to allow account
access even 10 days after revocation. Overall, we envision our framework as a
tool for enabling and guiding widespread remediation efforts by major SSO
identity providers, which were previously infeasible due to the sheer scale and
inherent mutability of this ecosystem._
