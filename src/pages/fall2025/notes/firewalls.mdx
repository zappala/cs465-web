# Firewalls

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 10](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf),
sections 10.0 - 10.2.

## Firewall basics

- Defensive technology
- Designed to screen out incoming traffic at the perimeter of an organization's
  network and also authorize outbound traffic

  - but also can be on individual machines

- note an organization may want to inspect outgoing traffic to ensure sensitive
  data isn't exfiltrated

<Image alt="basic firewall diagram" src={figure_10_1} />

- basic idea is that by default, no traffic comes in unless explicitly
  authorized
- outgoing traffic is allowed, along with any return traffic on the same
  connection

## Packet-filter firewall

- inspects individual packets using rules
  - often a "match first rule" system
  - actions are ACCEPT, DROP (no notice), REJECT (provide error), LOG
- filter rules usually based on:

  - source IP address
  - source port
  - destinaton IP address
  - destination port
  - protocol

- may also use ICMP type and code

- _stateless_ filters vs _stateful_ filters

  - a stateless filter examines each packet independently
  - a stateful filter can track TCP connection states, and thus treat packets
    belonging to an accepted TCP connection different from new connections

<Image alt="example packet-filter firewall rules" src={table_10_1} />

- example rules:

  - Rules 1-2 stop spoofed source IP addresses
  - Rule 3 denies packets from a known spam server
  - Rules 4-7 are for mail traffic -- allow incoming connections to a mail
    server (port 25) and responses, outgoing mail connections and responses
  - Rules 8-A allow outbound HTTP onnection requests, inbound responses, but
    reject inbound HTTP connection requests
  - Rules B-D are for DNS traffic -- outgoing queries, incoming queries and
    responsees
  - Rules E-H allow incoming and outgoing pings
  - Rule Z is to deny traffic by default when no other rules match

- limitations of firewalls

  - assumes a true perimeter exists -- now we have personal devices, USB drives,
    phones making the network defense more complicated
  - vulnerable to malicious insiders
  - trusted users may make bad connections
  - can be transited with tunnelling (e.g. a VPN)
  - can't screen encrypted content

## Proxy firewalls

- _circuit-level proxy firewalls_: relay an entire connection, either allow or
  deny, and then relay bytes

<Image alt="circuit-level proxy firewall" src={figure_10_2} />

- circuit-level proxy firewall

  - uses a socket daemon, _sockd_, on the firewall, and the SOCKS protocol to
    communicate
  - user --- sockd --- Internet site
  - separate TCP connections!
  - application -> intercepted by SOCKS library -> SOCKS protocol to sockd ->
    internet
  - connection is allowed or disallowed

- _application-level proxy firewalls_: relay application-specific traffic

<Image alt="application-level proxy firewall" src={figure_10_3} />

- application-level proxy firewall
  - able to inspect contents of packets since they have knowledge of the
    protocol
  - can remove malicious JavaScript, emails, etc.

## Enterprise firewall architectures

<Image alt="enterprise firewall architecture" src={figure_10_4} />

- the firewall (3) is exposed to the hostile newtork, so it maybe called a
  _bastion host_
- the web server and DNS server are public-facing, so they sit on a network
  right after the firewall, in a _demilitarized zone_ or DMZ
- there is a second internal firewall (4) that protects internal assets
- routers (1) and (2) provide connectivity
- provides defense in depth
