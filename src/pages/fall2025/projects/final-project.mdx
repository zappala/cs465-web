# Final Project

Spend two to three hours learning something new by trying additional CTF
challenges. You can use material on [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) or
[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org). For example, on pwn.college, look at topics such
as
[reverse engineering](https://pwn.college/program-security/reverse-engineering/),
[shellcode injection](https://pwn.college/program-security/shellcode-injection/),
or [kernel security](https://pwn.college/system-security/kernel-security/).
Alternatively, you'll find a wide variety of easy, medium, and hard challenges
on PicoCTF.

## Deliverables

Turn in:

- Screenshots of your progress after 3 hours
- One or two paragraphs explaining what you have learned (take an additional 10
  to 15 minutes to write this)
- One paragraph explaining the impact of this class on your future career (take
  5 minutes to write this)
