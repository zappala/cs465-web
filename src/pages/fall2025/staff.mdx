  Hello! CS 465 continues to evolve -- we're fine-tuning some assignments this
  year. My research area is usable security and privacy, which focuses on people
  and designing technology that fits their needs. My hobbies include reading,
  hiking, genealogy, and landscape photography. You can learn more about me at
  [zappala.byu.edu](https://zappala.byu.edu).
