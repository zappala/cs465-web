# Ethical Hacking Principles

An ethical hacker is someone who legally breaks into systems and networks to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.

For this assignment, write a 2-page paper explaining the ethical principles followed by a white-hat hacker and explain how these relate to gospel principles.

- Start by identifying resources that explain ethical hacking principles. There is no definitive list or approach, so consult multiple sources and gather as many unique principles as you can find. Take notes as you do this research.

- Next, consider a variety of gospel resources, including the scriptures and general conference talks. Do these principles echo or strengthen principles followed in industry? Does the gospel suggest any additional principles that an ethical hacker should follow? Again, take notes as you do this research.

- Finally, write a 2-page paper that summarizes what you know about ethical principles that white-hat hackers follow in industry and how the gospel relates to these principles.

- Be sure to cite all of your sources. You can do this with endnotes.
