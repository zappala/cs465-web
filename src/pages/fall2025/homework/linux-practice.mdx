# Homework: Linux Practice

For this homework, you're going to practice using the Linux command line.

If you have a Windows PC or a Mac with an Intel chip, the easiest way to do this
is with a VM, such as by using VMWare or VirtualBox. If you have a Mac with
Apple silicon, then you can do this the same way for this assignment, but
subsequent assignments will require you to use a VPS so that you can use an
x86-compatible chip. You're welcome to start early with a VPS now.

## VM setup

(1) Install VM software

- One option is
  [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion?pubDate=20250617)
  for Mac or
  [VMWare Worksation](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion?pubDate=20250617)
  for PC. VmWare is generally regarded as the best performing VM software. But
  you do need to register for an account to download it, and their login and
  download system is clunky.

- Another option is [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) for
  Mac, Windows, or Linux. No account registration needed.

- For Windows you can try
  [Hyper-V](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/educatordeveloperblog/step-by-step-enabling-hyper-v-for-use-on-windows-11/3745905).

(2) Set up Kali

- Download a
  [Kali Pre-built VM](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
- Open and run

## Alternative VPS Setup

You can use any VPS provider, such as AWS. I personally find Digital Ocean to be
easy and cheap, and they offer monthly payment plans so you can easily use a VPS
for just a few assignments and then tear it down.

## Linux command line

Use the [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) site to complete the
following sections:

- Command Line
- Text-Fu
- User Management
- Permissions
- Processes

For each section, run all the commands they show you, and play around. Create
directories and files. Add a new user. Change permissions on files.

Note, the following commands will not work:

- man: because man pages are not installed
- whatis: because man pages are not installed
- sudo: use root account instead

You can use Google to find the appropriate man pages as needed.

Finally, I recommend using `useradd` to add an account as shown. Try using `ssh`
to connect to that account with the password you create. What happens? Then
create an account using `useradd -m -s /bin/bash arwen`. Why does this work
better?

## Turn In

Submit a screenshot showing you running the history command on the Linux image from this homework.

## Grading

Homework is graded on a participation basis. Turn in this homework if you:

- Have a VPN or VPS to practice Linux.
- Have run at least 80% of the commands given

Note, if you are already a master with Linux (e.g. you have used it for several
years on a personal machine), then review all the material but you may skip
anything you already know. If you haven't set up a VM or used a VPS, be sure to at least try at least one of those.
