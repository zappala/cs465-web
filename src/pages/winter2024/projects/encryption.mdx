# Encryption

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain experience using cryptographic primitives
including symmetric encryption, public-key encryption, message authentication
codes, and digital signatures. You will use these together to implement a
hybrid-encryption scheme, a scheme that you could find in the real world.

In addition to teaching about cryptography, this lesson also serves to improve
your familiarity with enterprise-development languages and practices. This
includes introducing you to C#, containerized development, and reading through
online document. These are important real-world skills and practicing them in
this class will help give you an advantage when you enter the workforce.

## Requirements

In this project you will be implementing an encrypted echo client and server.

An echo server receives strings from clients and simply echos those strings back
to the clients. An echo client reads input from the terminal, sends that input
to the echo server, and prints to the terminal anything it receives from the
server.

I have provided you a working echo server and client that you will enhance to
secure communication using hybrid encryption. To complete this project, you will
need to modify the `EncryptedEchoServer.cs` and `EncryptedEchoClient.cs` files
to support hybrid encryption. Do not add, edit, or delete any other source
files.

When implementing the required functionality, make sure you use the same block
modes, padding, and hashing algorithms on the client and server, otherwise it
won't work. Use the ones indicated in this writeup and in the source code, or
your submission won't pass the autograder.

### Building and running the code

To build and run the code, do the following:

1. Open a terminal in VSCode. In this terminal, type `dotnet run server`. This
   runs the echo server.
1. Open a _second_ terminal in VSCode. In that terminal, type
   `dotnet run client`. This runs the echo client.

The code, as provided, functions as an _unencrypted_ echo client and server.
Type anything you want at the terminal for the client, and it sends this string
to the server, which sends the same string back. The client then outputs the
string on the terminal. So you should see:

```
hello who is this?
hello who is this?
I'm Sarah
I'm Sarah
what a coincidence
what a coincidence
```

To aid you in testing your code, I've provided an `echo-test` binary. It
contains a working encrypted echo server and client. Run them using
`./echo-test server` and `./echo-test client`, respectively. This can be used to
test your own implementations. For example, run your server with the echo-test
client, or run your client with the echo-test server. If you can run against
these tools without any issue, you should receive full credit on passoff (unless
you cut corners around key generation). If you are using an arm device (like the
mac M1/M2) use `echo-test-arm` in the above commands.

Note that this allows you to write code for just the client, test and debug it,
before writing the code for the server. You should eventually be able to run
your client with your server, using encryption, with no issues.

### Client-Server Protocol

The protocol you will build should do the following:

![encryption project](/images/projects/encryption-protocol.png)

- The server generates an RSA key pair, (S, V)
- The client sends the server a Hello message
- The server response includes its RSA public key, V
- The client creates a symmetric encryption key K and an HMAC key H
- The client sends a message that includes:
  - E<sub>V</sub>(K) -- the key K, encrypted with V
  - IV -- the AES initialization vector
  - E<sub>K</sub>(message) -- a message, encrypted with key K
  - E<sub>V</sub>(H) -- the key H, encrypted with V
  - HMAC<sub>H</sub>(message) -- the HMAC of the message, using key H
- The server responds with a message that includes:
  - message -- not encrypted
  - E<sub>S</sub>(SHA256(message)) -- a signature of the SHA256 hash of the
    message, using key S

### Echo Client

Start by writing the client and testing it with the solution server. On the
client you will implement three methods:

1. `ProcessServerHello`: This method will read a RSA public key sent by the
   server when the client first connects. This key will be encoded using Base64.
2. `TransformOutgoingMessage`: This method will be responsible for applying
   hybrid encryption to the messages typed into the console:
   1. You will need to generate an AES, message encryption key. You will use
      this key to encrypt the message using CBC mode and PKCS7 padding. You
      should use a different key each time you encrypt a message.
   2. You will need to generate an HMAC for your plaintext message. Use the
      SHA256 variant of the HMAC algorithm. Generate a random key each time you
      generate a HMAC.
   3. Encrypt the two keys you generated using RSA. Use the OAEP padding scheme
      with SHA256.
3. `TransformIncomingMessage`: This method will be responsible for processing
   messages sent by the echo server and validating their digital signatures.
   Make sure to use PSS padding with SHA256.

### Echo Server

After your client works with the solution server, write your server and test it
with the solution client. Your server will need to generate an RSA key upon
starting. It will also need to implement three methods:

1. `GetServerHello`: Returns the server's RSA public key encoded using Base64.
2. `TransformIncomingMessage`: This method will be responsible for applying
   hybrid encryption to the messages typed into the console:
   1. Decrypt the message encryption and HMAC keys using the server's RSA key.
   2. Decrypt the message with AES using CBC mode and PKCS7 padding.
   3. Verify the HMAC of the received message. Use the SHA256 variant of the
      HMAC algorithm.
3. `TransformOutgoingMessage`: This method will be responsible for using the
   server's RSA key to digitally sign messages being sent by the server. Make
   sure to use PSS padding with SHA256.

## Cryptographic Library

The cryptographic primitives needed in this project can all be found in the
`System.Security.Cryptography` namespace. You will need the `AES`, `RSA`,
`HMACSHA256`, and `RandomNubmerGenerator` classes to complete this lab. Read up
on how they work. Be sure to look at the _methods_ for these classes. Don't use
the example code. Instead, find and learn to use each of the appropriate
methods.

## Resources

C# as a language sits between C/C++ and Java. Like Java, it is a high-level
language, that abstracts many details about memory management and types. Like
C/C++ it allows low-level access to hardware. You will only need a basic
understanding of C# to complete this lab. The following are some resources to
get you started about C# and its libraries:

- [A tour of the C# language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/)
- [System.Security.Cryptography](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography?view=net-7.0)
  documentation. You can find documentation for any security functionality you
  will need on linked from this page. Some items you may want to look at
  include,
  - RandomNumberGenerator
  - RSA
  - AES
  - HMACSHA256
  - CryptographicException
- [System.Text.Encoding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding?view=net-7.0)
  for converting between text and bytes.
- [System.Convert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert?view=net-7.0)
  for Base64 encodings.
