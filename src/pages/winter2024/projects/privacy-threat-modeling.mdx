# Privacy threat modeling

## Objectives

In addition to thinking carefully about security threats, businesses need to
thinks carefully about privacy threats. This project is intended to help you
learn how a company might perform privacy threat modeling.

## Requirements

For this project, you will use the [LINDDUN GO](https://linddun.org/go/) privacy
threat modeling framework. This method uses a
[set of cards](https://downloads.linddun.org/linddun-go/default/v240118/go.pdf)
to help you think through the process and elicit potential threats. The
[instructions](https://linddun.org/go-getting-started/) describe a process where
you use the cards to elicit a set of realistic privacy threats, based on a
sketch of a company's system. However, we will just have you use the cards to
provide you with a list of a wide variety of privacy threats.

1. Examine the cards to familiarize yourself with privacy threats. The card deck
   starts with some instructions. Then, on pages 5--18 you will see a set of
   cards displaying threat types. Finally, starting on page 19 you will see
   cards for individual threats, each with a threat number at the bottom left,
   e.g. L1. The last threat is the card on page 83. Each threat card corresponds
   to one of the types covered at the front of the deck.

1. Choose a company thta stores data about people. Ideally you will have some
   familiarity about the type of data this company stores.

1. Using the list of cards, identify a set of threats you think are realistic
   for this company's system.

1. Write a 2 page report describing potential privacy threats for the company.
   The report should start with a description of the company and the types of
   data they store. Then discuss the potential threats. For each threat,
   identify (a) the threat type, (b) the relevant threat card, (c) a detailed
   description of the threat, and (d) your estimate of the severity of the
   threat (Low, Medium, High).

Notice that this is similar to security threat modeling, answering questions
such as _What does the company do?_ and _What can go wrong?_. You will not cover
mitigations or evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigations.

You can also see
[an overview of privacy threat types](https://linddun.org/threat-types/) and
[some examples](https://linddun.org/cases/).

## Submission

List the full name of all group members in your report. Have one group member
submit a PDF with your group's report. We will give identical grades to all
group members.
