# Threat Modeling

## Objectives

Learning to think like an attacker is a critical part of cybersecurity. In this
project, you will observe a system and consider how you might exploit it. You
will also gain experience using the DREAD and STRIDE models discussed in class.

## Requirements

**In this project, you should work with up to three partners (groups of 2–4
people).** If you really want to, you are permitted to work alone.

With your partners, observe people in a public place using a computerized
system. For example, you might observe people using a public transit ticket
machine, a parking garage pay station, a hardware store self-checkout machine, a
library self-checkout machine, or an airport self-check-in kiosk. Stay long
enough to observe 3–5 people use the system. Also, if possible, try using the
system at least once yourself to understand how it works.

Based on your observations, write a report about the system containing the
following sections:

1. _System description_
   - What was the system?
   - Who is supposed to use the system? What are their tasks? What are their
     goals?
2. _Diagrams_
   - Diagram the user workflow.
   - Produce a data flow diagram for the system.
     - As you don't have access to the inner workings of the system, make
       reasonable guesses to fill in this diagram.
3. _Asset analysis_
   - What assets exists in this system?
   - What assets are most valuable?
4. _Adversary analysis_
   - Who might try to attack the system? _(hint: remember Table 1.2 in the
     book)_
     - Are they an insider or outsider?
   - What are their objectives?
   - What are their methods?
   - What are their capabilities?
   - You should identify at least three adversaries.
5. _Attack trees_
   - Create 1–2 attack trees for each of the adversaries you identified.
   - You must have at least 5 attack trees.
   - Your analysis must have at least two adversaries and five attack trees.
6. _Defender analysis_
   - Who is trying to defend the system?
   - What resources do they have access to?
     - As you don't have access to the inner workings of the system, make
       reasonable guesses about this information.
7. _Risk analysis_
   - Use the DREAD model to evaluate the risk for five of the attack trees.
     - Make sure you take into account all relevant information, including
       attacker capabilities and defender resources.
     - As you don't have access to the inner workings of the system, make
       reasonable guesses to fill in the model.
8. _Mitigations_
   - Propose three mitigations that could lower the calculated risk for any of
     the attack trees.
   - Recalculate risk using DREAD taking into account these mitigations.
     Identify which of the DREAD calculations
   - you updated from the previous section.
9. _Reflect_
   - Reflect on what you have learned in this assignment.
     - What did you learn about the system?
     - How does this impact how you think of security?
   - This should be 2–3 paragraphs.

## Grading Rubric

- 10 points for the system description section.
- 10 points for the diagrams section.
- 20 points for the asset analysis section.
- 20 points for the adversary analysis section.
- 20 points for the attack tree section.
- 20 points for the defender analysis section.
- 20 points for the risk analysis section.
- 20 points for the mitigations section.
- 20 points for the reflection section.

For each section, we will be looking to see that the report covers all the
requested items and that an honest effort has been made. I am not looking for
perfection, especially since you are new to threat analysis and do not have
access to all the information about the system.

The TA may deduct up to 20% of your grade for poor writing quality. This penalty
will only be accessed if the writing is so poor as make it difficult for the TA
to read and understand the report. This penalty will not be used to punish minor
writing errors. If you run a grammar and spelling check, most students should
not need to worry about this penalty.

## Submission

Have all group members join one of the groups on Canvas. Then have one group
member submit a PDF with your group's report on Canvas.
