# Web Exploit and Path

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain hands-on experience (i) recognizing cross-site
scripting attacks and (ii) modifying and creating web request to attack backend
web APIs, and (iii) conducting basic SQL injection attacks. You will also
practice identify and patching vulnerabilities in web source code.

A secondary objective of this project is to give you experience with ethical
hacking and OWASP training resources. Also, you will gain experience using the
developer tools built into your browser, an important skill for web development.

## Background

In this project you will be looking for vulnerabilities in a realistic website.
You will also be learning how to address those vulnerabilities. These
vulnerabilities will be from the following categories:

- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  - Reflected and stored
- Vulnerable web APIs
- SQL injection

The vulnerable website you will be attacking is provided by OWASP. OWASP (Open
Worldwide Application Security Project) as an organization aims to promote
knowledge about web vulnerabilities and mitigation's. This website, the Juice
Shop, is a teaching tool for gaining hands-on experience with a wide range of
web vulnerabilities. In this project, you will only be completing a small
fraction of the challenges available for this website, and after this class this
will remain an excellent source to sharpen your web hacking skills.

## Requirements

To start, visit the
[Juice Shop information website](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/). You should
read the preface and skim over Section 1. You will need to follow the
instructions in `Part 1: Running OWASP Juice Shop` to get this project setup and
running. Personally, I recommend that you run Juice Shop using docker. This can
be done with a single command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_ENV=unsafe bkimminich/juice-shop
```

Next, download and unzip the [handout](/code/web-exploit-and-patch.zip). It
contains the `submission.md` file you will submit as well as a `README.md` file
that has some hints for completing this project.

After you have downloaded these files, you are ready to start the project. Your
first task will be to find the scoreboard -- see `Part 2` of the website,
`Finding the Scoreboard`. After that, you will complete the following
challenges:

1. DOM XSS
2. Reflected XSS
3. Forged Review
4. Login Admin
5. Admin Section
6. Admin Registration
7. API-Only XSS

For each of these challenges, you will be exploit a vulnerability in the Juice
Shop website. After exploiting the vulnerability, you will then be able to see
the vulnerable source code and identify a patch for that code.

I recommend that you complete these challenges in order. They increase in
difficulty as you go. Additionally, some of the later challenges will be much
easier if you have completed the previous challenges.

As described in the writeup, you should treat the OWASP Juice Shop server as a
black box (i.e., don't look at its server code, whether running locally or on
GitHub). You are free to look at any client-side scripts or resources sent to
the browser, just as an adversary would. Do not look for solutions online, as
this is considered cheating.

### Identifying Vulnerabilities

As you do not have access to the server's source code, you will need to poke
around the website to find vulnerabilities. The website, in
`Part 1: Walking the "happy path"`, has suggestions for parts of the website you
might explore to identify vulnerabilities. It is also worth looking at the
`main.js` file. I recommend that you make liberal use of your browser's
developer tools, particularly the network tab. The scoreboard may also have
hints at where you can start looking for issues.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

Next, you will need to identify how you will craft an exploit from the
identified vulnerability. Leverage what you learned in class. You are also
allowed to search the web for information about how to exploit web
vulnerabilities. As long as you don't lookup a walkthrough for the problem, you
are not breaking the rules. If you get stuck, you can also see if the scoreboard
provides a tutorial. If so, this is also not considered cheating.

### Patching the vulnerability

For each of the vulnerabilities, you will need to identify how you would patch
the vulnerability. The Juice Shop scoreboard will help you do so as all but one
challenge also has a coding challenge attached to the main challenge. The coding
challenge is available after completing the main challenge, and is found by
clicking the farthest right button on the challenge row on the scoreboard. After
completing the coding challenge, you will copy the correct patch code into
`sumission.md`.

## Writeup

I have provided a `submission.md` file that you will use to writeup your
results. This is the file you will submit and be graded on.

For each problem, this file has a place for you to list the following
information:

1. The list the steps necessary to execute the exploit.
2. An explanation of what the vulnerability was.
3. An explanation of how you would patch the vulnerability.
4. The patch from the coding challenge.

## Recommended Resources

I recommend choosing one of the following ways to find and exploit vulnerabilities:

- Using [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools) is the easiest way to do it. This program will let you see and modify traffic between the browser and the server.
- Using the browser's
  [developer console](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/), if you prefer to learn the details of the developer console instead of relying on a separate tool. An
  example of how to do so can be seen in
  [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22931720/is-there-a-way-to-modify-an-http-request-in-chrome-or-firefox).

These tools are also available as an alternative to Burp Suite:

- [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
- [Tamper Dev](https://tamper.dev/)

In this project, you are also free to search the web for additional details
about the attacks you will need to conduct. Don't search for solutions, but you
are otherwise free to use online resources. This is how real hacking works and
is an important skill to build. Some websites that might be helpful include,

- [Cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)
- [SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
- [REST APIs](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [React](https://react.dev/). This is the technology used to built Juice Shop.
  Don't feel the need to read this all, but could be a helpful resource to
  search for specific questions.

We have also included a `pentesting.pdf` in the handout that you may find useful.

## Grading Rubric

For most problems, you can receive 40 points:

- 15 points for listing the steps needed to execute your exploit
- 10 points for explaining what the vulnerability is
- 10 points for explaining how to patch the vulnerability (in a general sense)
- 5 points for correctly copying the patch from the coding challenge

Several problems slightly deviate from this grading rubric:

- You will not receive any points for finding the scoreboard. However, you will
  lose 20 points if you do not describe how you found it.
- The Reflected XSS problem does not have a coding challenge. You will receive
  those five points for correctly describing how to patch the vulnerability (in
  a general sense).
- The API-Only XSS is worth double points (80 points). This challenges
  incorporates what you have learned from previous steps and is significantly
  harder.

In total, 320 points are available for this project.
