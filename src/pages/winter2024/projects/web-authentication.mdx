# Web Authentication

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain experience implementing proper hash-based
password authentication on a website. This includes gaining experience using
salted passwords, iterated hashing, and memory hard hashing functions. You will
also gain experience using PBKDF2, BCrypt, and Argon2id, preparing you to
implement and support password-based authentication in real-world applications.

In addition to teaching about cryptography, this lessons will also provide
exposure to a modern Web application framework: ASP.NET using Razor. You will
also continue increasing your familiarity with containerized development.

## Requirements

In this project, you will be implementing four password hashing algorithms:

1. Iterated hashing using SHA255
2. PBKDF2
3. BCrypt
4. Argon2id

Working with cryptographic functions can be tricky. This lab will help you get
hands on experience using these functions.

To complete this project, you will take the following steps:

1. Download and unzip the [handout](/files/web-authentication-handout.tar.gz).
2. Open the project using Visual Studio Code. Build and reopen in a dev
   container.
3. Modify the following files to implement the various hash algorithms.
   1. `/Areas/Identity/IterativeHasher.cs`
   2. `/Areas/Identity/PBDKF2Hasher.cs`
   3. `/Areas/Identity/BCryptHasher.cs`
   4. `/Areas/Identity/Argon2IdHasher.cs`

To run your server, you will use `dotnet run`. After starting up, the server can
be accessed at [http://localhost:5126](http://localhost:5126).

When implementing the required functionality, make sure you use the settings
given to you in this writeup and in the files themselves. If you do not, your
code may still work but will not pass the autograder.

If you want functionality shared between the four hashers, you can put it in
`/Areas/Identity/Utils.cs`. That file also contains an Encoding (ASCII) that you
should use if you ever need to convert from a password to bytes.

## Password Hashing

For each hasher, you will be implementing two functions:

1. `HashPassword`: This function takes a password as input and returns a value
   to store in the database that can later be used to verify the password.
   **Critically, this is not just the hash of the password, but must contain all
   necessary information needed to later verify a password.** For example, it
   must contain the salt.
2. `VerifyHashedPassword`: This function takes a password and the stored
   password verifier, and returns whether the password is valid based on the
   stored verifier. It is up to this function to properly decode the value from
   the database.

### Iterative Hasher

For this hasher, you will be using SHA256 to hash passwords. You must use a
random 32-byte salt. You must produce a 32-byte digest. You must also use
100,000 iterations. The value stored to the database should be encoded as
`Base64(salt):Base64(digest)`.

When hashing, only the first iteration incorporates the salt. It should do so by
prepending the salt's bytes to the password's bytes.

### PBDKF2 Hasher

For this hasher, you will be using PBKDF2 to hash passwords. You must use a
random 32-byte salt. You must produce a 32-byte digest. You must also use
100,000 iterations. Internally, the PBKDF2 algorithm needs to be set to use
SHA256. The value stored to the database should be encoded as
`Base64(salt):Base64(digest)`.

You should use the
[Rfc2898DeriveBytes.Pbkdf2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rfc2898derivebytes.pbkdf2?view=net-7.0)
method.

### BCrypt Hasher

For this hasher, you will be using BCrypt to hash passwords. BCrypt should use
between 100,000 and 200,000 iterations (there is only one value that will work,
which you can find by reading the documentation).

You should use the [bcrypt.net - next](https://github.com/BcryptNet/bcrypt.net)
library.

### Argon2id Hasher

For this hasher, you will be using Argon2id to hash passwords. You must use a
random 32-byte salt. You must produce a 32-byte digest. You must use 8 degrees
of parallelism, 4 iterations, and a memory size of 128MB. The value stored to
the database should be encoded as `Base64(salt):Base64(digest)`.

You should use the
[Konscious.Security.Cryptography](https://github.com/kmaragon/Konscious.Security.Cryptography)
library.

## Testing

You can test your solution by registering and logging in as various users.

To aid you in testing your code, I've also provided an `app-test.db` file that
has properly encoded passwords for each of the four password hashing algorithms.
Feel free to look at this file in the SQLite database explorer to see if your
hashed passwords look correct. Additionally, you may copy this database to
`app.db` to use it with your code and ensure that you can login with the
following four users:

| Username  | Password  |
| --------- | --------- |
| Iterative | Iterative |
| PBKDF2    | PBKDF2    |
| BCrypt    | BCrypt    |
| Argon2id  | Argon2id  |
