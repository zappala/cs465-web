# Certificates, certification authorities, and PKI

## Ungraded quiz

- If an attacker can give you the wrong public key for a website or a person,
  what does this enable them to do?

- What is a public key certificate used for?

- What is a trust model?

- What trust model do web browsers use?

## Key Concepts

### Public key certificates

- a _public key certificate_ associate a public key with an owner
  - combination of Subject and public key signed by a Certification Authority
    (CA)
  - a _relying party_ relies on this certification authority and trusts its
    signature
  - see
    [Table 8.1, page 215](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
    for a list of fields that can appear in a certificate
  - _Subject_ and _Issuer_ are of type _Name_, which is a set of attributes and
    values
- CA's can issue certificates for humans, web servers
- see
  [page 216](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  for a list of steps that a CA takes before issuing a certificate

- _public key infrastructure_ (PKI) -- infrastructure used for managing public
  keys, private keys, and their use

  - authenticate entities and establish session keys
  - allows the use of encryption, digital signatures, etc
  - see
    [Figure 8.1, page 217](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - includes a set of standards from the International Telecommunication Union
    (ITU) -- X.509
  - long term storage of private keys is challenging -- whether for a website, a
    cryptocurrency wallet, or any other use

### Certificate chain validation

- Validating a certificate chain

  - see
    [Figure 8.2, page 218](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - requires a root of trust
  - see list of steps, below the figure

- Verifying public keys using an out-of-band channel

  - see the example in the book -- involving a hash of a public key using a
    numeric or image representation
  - for example, verifying a contact's public key in WhatsApp or Signal

- Terms
  - _self-sign certificate_ -- signed by yourself instead of a CA
  - _trusted certificate store_ (or root store) -- trusted certificates to
    bootstrap a chain
  - _untrusted certificates_ -- see
    [Figure 8.3, page 219](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - _TOFU_ -- trust on first use + _key continuity_ -- see
    [MailPile](https://www.mailpile.is) and
    [autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/index.html) for TOFU for email (note, does
    not seem to be in active development)
    - TOFU is also often used with SSH!
  - _revocation_ -- used whena public key has been compromised, e.g. by adding a
    revoked certificate to a list (CRL)

### CA/PKI architectures

- _trust model_ -- rules and processes to determine which certificates are
  trusted

  - will vary depending on the application
  - consider a private network among automotive suppliers vs secure email for
    the government vs secure communications between consumers and websites

- Model 1: Single-CA systems

  - see
    [Figure 8.5, page 225](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - can be connected with a ring or bridge

- Model 2: Strict Hierarchy

  - see
    [Figure 8.6, page 226](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - can use reverse-certificates to traverse the hierarchy from bottom up

- Model 3: Ring-mesh of tree roots

  - like Model 1, but each single-CA is a hierarchy

- Model 4: Forest of hierarchical trees (browser model)

  - see
    [Figure 8.7, page 227](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - configure all browsers with a set of trust anchors (root store)

- Model 5: Decentralized CA Trust (Enterprise PKI model)

  - see
    [Figure 8.8, page 227](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf)
  - may be disconnected -- does not need universal connectivity
  - can decide which trust anchors to import to your company

- Model 6: Web of Trust

  - no CAs
  - every person decides who to trust
  - originally envisioned _key signing parties_

- two key elements
  - trust anchors
  - CA certificates (where a CA certifies another CA)

## Challenge Question

- If you had to build a PKI for certificates issued to humans, how would you do
  this?
