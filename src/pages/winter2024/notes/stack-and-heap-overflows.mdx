# Stack and Heap Overflows

## Ungraded Quiz

- Explain how a stack-based buffer overflow attack works
- Explain how a heap-based buffer overflow attack works
- Why would an attacker use a heap spray attack?

## Relevance

- Both stack and heap overflow attacks are REALLY common -- see
  [CVE list](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/opov-1/overflow.html)

## Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Attacks

- Understand memory layout of a process -- see
  [Figure 6.3, page 166](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
  - A buffer is allocated in BSS using a C declaration such as:
    `static int bufferX[4]`
- Understand how a process uses the stack -- see
  [Figure 6.4, page 167](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
- In a stack overflow, the attacker tries to write code to the stack and get the
  OS to execute it
- see Example, _Buffer Overflow_, page 167,
  [Figure 6.5, page 168](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
- understand what a no-op sled is and why an attacker would use it

## Heap-based Buffer Overflow Attacks

- Dangerous when the heap is both writeable and executable
- see
  [Figure 6.6, page 169](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
  to understand why an attacker writing to the heap is dangerous
- see
  [Figure 6.7, page 169](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
  for an example of overwriting a function pointer
- understand the types of state that can be corrupted
  - jump table -- see below
  - setjump -- seee
    [Wikipedia page on setjump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp.h)
- understand exploit steps
- understand elements of a heap spraying attack -- see
  [Figure 6.8, page 170](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)

Jump table:

```c
MyJump(int c)
{
   switch(state)
   {
      case 0:
         goto func0label;
      case 1:
         goto func1label;
      case 2:
         goto func2label;
   }
}
```
