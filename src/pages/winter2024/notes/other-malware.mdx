# Other Malware

## Ungraded Quiz

- Explain how ransomware uses cryptography to restrict access to a victim's files
- What is a zero-day exploit? Why is it so dangerous?

## Key Concepts

### Browser-based malware

- visiting a web page authorizees running its content in the browser
- _drive-by download_: visiting a web page causes malware to be silently downloaded and run, taking advantage of browser vulnerability
- malicious JavaScript may be
  - ads (ad blockers are a security tool not just a protection from annoyances)
  - web widgets
  - user-provided content (e.g. on a site that allows comments)
  - malicious parameters in URL links
- if you can get the browser to visit an unintended web page, that web page may host the malware
  - easy to use redirects without the user noticing
  - easy to hide content in zero-pixel iframe
- _dropper_: installs other malware

### Ransomware

- malware that encrypts a user's files and asks for payment in return for decryption key
- often demand cryptocurrency payment
- [see the details on cryptography used by ransomeware, page 202](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch7-rev1.pdf)
- _Wannacry_ was a ransomware worm that used a separate encryption key for each file

### Botnets

- collection of machines that have been compromised by shell code
- controlled by a machine or machines (command and control or C&C)
  - may be peer-to-peer
  - may involve a hierarchy, with controller at the top
  - try to obscure the channels to avoid the control being shut down
  - try to obscrure the channels to avoid being caught
- can be used for
  - denial of service attacks
  - spam campaigns -- sell stuff, or generate traffic
  - install keyloggers to get financial info

### Zero-day exploits

- an attack that takes advantage of a new vulnerability
- gives the community no time to prepare before the malware is released
- for anything that is non-zero-day, we know about the attack and we have ways to fix it, and yet systems remain unpatched

### Logic bomb

- malware that is triggered by a particular sequence of actions (e.g. a particular user logging in, a particular date)

### Social engineering

- manipulating a person into performing an action or divulging confidential information
- see [Happy99 virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy99)
- common trick used by penetration tester to gain access to a company's resources (with permission!)

### Malware objectives and properties

- [see list of objectives, page 206](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch7-rev1.pdf)
