# Directories, links, and role-based access Control

## Key concepts

### Directories

![UNIX file system hierarchy](/images/notes/unix-filesystem.png)

- remember, everything is a file
- this means a directory entry is a file
  - the data in the file is the file system data for the sub-directories and files in that directory
  - the meta-data for the directory entry are the permissions data, a flag indicating this is a directory, and a pointer to the data block
  - the directory entries always include "." meaning this directory, and ".." meaning the parent directory
- permissions for directories include:

  - r: you can list the contents of the directory -- view the `dir-entries` for that directory
  - w: you add edit directory content, meaning alter `dir-entries`, such as creating, moving, or deleting files -- requires x permission too
  - x: you can traverse and search the directory, e.g. using the `find` command
  - t-bit: prevent deletion or renaming of files owned by other users

- [See Figure 5.6, page 140](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf) to understand the UNIX directory structure

- [see Figure 5.7, page 142](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf) to understand the distinction between the mental model of a file system and its implementation

- a _chroot jail_ limits visibility of the file system using `chroot`
  - doesn't extend to process or networking space -- meaning you can create a child process that goes outside of the \_chroot
  - see [here](https://tbhaxor.com/breaking-out-of-chroot-jail-shell-environment/) for a good explanation
  - FreeBSD has a `jail()` that is stricter and describes what processes a process may influence, what network services they can use, etc., see [here](https://papers.freebsd.org/2000/phk-jails.files/sane2000-jail.pdf)

### Links

- a _hard link_ is a direct alias to a file -- the `dir-entry` points to the same file object
- a _symbolic link_ is a n indirect alias to a file -- the `dir-entry` points to an inode whose datablock contains the pathname of the original file
- see [Figure 5.8, page 143](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf)
- some important differences, see [Figure 5.9, page 143](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf)
- experiment with these!

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

- assign permissions to objects (files) based on roles
- if a person/subject changes roles, they get new access by being granted that role or can lose access by having a role removed
- can be much easier than having to change permissions for individual files each time people change roles

### Mandatory access control and SELinux

- useful for organizations or the government -- who you are determines which files you have access to, and this is controlled by an administrator, e.g. a security clearance
- SELinux is a Linux Security Module that provides mandatory access control for Linux
- demonstrates that you can take a commodity operating system and provide mandatory access control
- originally developed by the NSA
- integrates role-based access control
