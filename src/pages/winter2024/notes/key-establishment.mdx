# Key Establishment

## Ungraded Quiz

- What is the purpose of the Diffie-Hellman protocol?

- Can you explain how a man-in-the-middle attack works to subvert
  Diffie-Hellman?

- What do we need to add to prevent attacks against DH?

## Key Concepts

### Key Establishment

- Important question -- how do Bob and Alice create a key that they share?

- They could share the key in person, e.g. using a USB drive.
- Alice could generate a key and then encrypt it with Bob's public key -- e.g.
  hybrid encryption.

  - If someone records the conversation and then steals Bob's private key, they
    can decrypt everything

- _Key agreement protocol_ -- both parties contribute some information to derive
  a shared key
  - the generated key is ephemeral -- used only for a short time, destroyed
    after use
  - no long term secrets -- so even if an attacker steals Bob's private key and
    has a record of the conversation, they can't compute the derived key

### Diffie Hellman

- "allows two parties with no prior contact nor any pre-shared keying material,
  to establish a shared secret by exchanging numbers over a channel readable by
  everyone else." Pretty amazing!

- Be able to understand and follow the DH protocol,
  [explained on page 101](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch4-rev1.pdf)

- Computing a from g<sup>a</sup> and public parameters _g_ and _p_ is called the
  discrete logarithm problem -- computationally difficult if _p_ is chosen with
  certain properties

- Once you derive DH key K, you put it into a _key derivation function_ to get
  the actual key used.

- Textbook DH is susceptible to various attacks -- see the book for details --
  you should know to be careful about checking these details

- Textbook DH is unauthenticated -- an active attacker can easily subvert it.
  You should be able to explain this attack. See
  [page 102](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch4-rev1.pdf)

- The STS protocol adds digital signatures to DH. You should be able to see a
  description like the one in the book and understand it.

### Key authentication properties and goals

- forward secrecy -- disclosure of a long-term secret does not compromise the
  secrecy of session keys used for earlier sessions

- known-key security -- compromised session keys do not allow later
  impersonation or compromise future session keys

- entity authentication and liveness -- if you verify an entity is actively
  participating in a protocol, this gives you _liveness_

- key-use confirmation -- you can verify a party has a session key without
  verifying who they are

- implicit authentication -- encrypting a session key using RSA -- you know the
  other party is the only one that can get the session key, but you don't know
  if they have received it

- implicit authentication + key-use confirmation = explicit authentication

- if you want to see details, study the STS implementation details, then read
  through the informal explanation of the properties provided
