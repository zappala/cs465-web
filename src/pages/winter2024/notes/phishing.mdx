# Phishing

## Ungraded Quiz

- What is the difference between phishing and spear phishing?
- Why is phishing still prevalent after so many years of trying to stop it?

## Types of Phishing Attacks

- _phishing_: tricks a person into visiting a fraudulent version of a legitimate
  website, with the goal of obtaining sensitive information -- passwords,
  banking information, credit card details

- _spear phishing_: targeted to a particular individual or organization

  - can be more convincing since it is targeting an individual
  - attacker will research the target in advance
  - can purport to come from a known contact or include reference to known
    information

- _whaling_: targeted to higher-level management

- [see Crowdstrike explanation and examples](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing/spear-phishing/)

## Phishing enablers

- _mental model_: a person's understanding of how a system works and what it
  does

  - influences a person's security-related decisions / threat model
  - phishing may exploit flaws in a person's mental model
  - software developers (especially working in security) should try to align
    their software with mental models

- URLs by design hide the actual link
- typosquatting
- redirects
- web design that looks like the authentic website or "looks trustworthy"
- copycate domains, like `paypal-security.com` or `pay.pal.com`
- misunderstanding that the lock icon means a site is "safe"

## Phishing defenses

- spam filtering
- domain filtering
- user education

- notes of interest
  - transient phishing sites are a problem
  - once users are on a fraudulent site, even experts have a hard time detecting
    this

## Security indicators

- a closed padlock icon
- HTTPS
- warnings (Not Secure)

- regular changes may be confusing
- differences between browsers

- [Rethinking Connection Security Indicators](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2016/soups2016-paper-porter-felt.pdf)
  -- if you want to see justification for Chrome's designs

- distinguishing between "not secure" (not using HTTPS) vs "unsafe" (hosting
  malware) -- see
  [Google Safe Browsing project](https://safebrowsing.google.com)

## Usable security

- area of research that combines human factors and security

  - merges two areas of CS (HCI, security)
  - frequently uses theories and methods from psychology and sociology

- see
  [Table 9.3, page 273](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)
  and discussion to see some examples of design principles
