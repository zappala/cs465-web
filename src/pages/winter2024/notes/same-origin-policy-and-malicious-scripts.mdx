# Same origin policy and malicious scripts

## Ungraded Quiz

- explain the Same-Origin policy -- what is it and why do browsers need it?
- Sketch out a CSRF attack
- Describe how CSRF tokens work to prevent a CSRF attack

## Key concepts

### Same origin policy

- goal #1: prevent JavaScript from one site interfering with a web page from
  another site
  - without this, a malicious site could load JavaScript to read your credit
    card details on another site that you have loaded
- goal #2: allow friendly domains to share scripts (e.g. two divisions of the
  same company), allow ads from third parties
- reminder -- sharing scripts is possible with

```javascript
<script src="https://domain2/script.js" />
```

- origin = (scheme, host, port)
- same origin policy

  - lets a site load scripts, images, documents, etc from a different origin
  - but prevents the site from _reading_ the script, image, document, etc that
    is loaded
  - also prevents a fetch() from the site to another origin

- [see Figure 9.5, page 258](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)
- [see rules for matching origins, page 259](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)

- the book discusses relaxing the same-origin policy by manipulating
  `document.domain`.
  [This is now disallowed by browsers.](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain)

  - [see also MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain)

- different same-origin rules for cookies

- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) -- Cross-origin
  Resource Sharing allows a _server_ to set policy for which origins may request
  its content via a fetch

### Malicious scripts

- _authentication cookies_
  - used to identify a session _after_ login
  - `Set-Cookie: sessionID=abcd12345`
  - should be sufficiently random and thus not easy to guess
  - should have an expiration time
- cookie theft

  - need to avoid sending cookies to malicious sites: `HTTPOnly` cookie attriute
  - need to avoid malicious HTTP proxies: `Secure` cookie attribute
  - non-script client-side malware (e.g. keylogger, malicious browser extension)
  - access to cookie storage on client side

- sensitive data in cookies should be encrypted and protected with a MAC (e.g.
  authenticated encryption) or encrypted and signed

- _CSRF_: Cross-Site Request Forgery

  - goal of the attacker is to control what is sent in a request that is
    authorized by an authentication cookie
  - [see examples, page 261 and 262](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)
  - can be hidden in a link or a zero-pixel image

- notes on CRSF

  - can't rely on checking IP addresses, since the request comes from the victim
  - requires a current session -- hence financial sites regularly log you out
  - can use an injected script, but doesn't require one

- CRSF mitigation: secret validation tokens
