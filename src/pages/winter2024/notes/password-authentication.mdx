# Password authentication

## Ungraded Quiz

- Why should websites always hash the passwords they store?
- What role does the salt play when hashing passwords?
- Why should a password hashing algorithm be relatively slow?
- Why can the concept of entropy lead to misleading conclusions about password
  security?

## Key concepts

### Password authentication

- never store passwords as cleartext -- if your password database is stolen, the
  attacker now knows all passwords and can try them on other sites
- instead store hash of the password, using a cryptographic hash function

- dictionary attack
- offline vs online attacks
- password capture -- shoulder-surfing, keyloggers, malware, phishing, social
  engineering
- password interface bypass
- defeating recovery mechanisms

- password composition policies are designed to help users pick passwords that
  are "stronger" by requiring minimum lengths and different types of characters
  (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters)
  - [NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) now recommends only
    password lengths be enforced -- 8 characters minimum

  - considers security, usability, and deployability

> Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits:
> none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already
> provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor
> security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant
> security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult
> to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction
> because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world
> constraints.

### Password-guessing strategies and defenses

- system administrators should use rate-limiting to throttle online guessing
  attacks
- system administrators should use salting and hashing to slow down offline
  guessing attacks

  - hashing should be iterated, meaning using multiple rounds, e.g. 1000 rounds
    of hashing -- longer hashing times make it harder for the attacker to brute
    force guess passwords from a database breach
  - hashing should use a salt to combat dictionary attacks
  - hashing should use a specialized password-hashing function, e.g. Argon2

- system administrators may use a pepper -- like a salt, but stored separately,
  e.g. in an HSM (hardware security module)
- system administrators should check user passwords against breach databases to
  limit daamage from online and offline guessing attacks

See
[OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

- user chosen passwords are not random

### Entropy

- information-theoretic entropy (Shannon's entropy) conveys how much information
  is revealed by an event
- takes into account all possible events and their probability
- often misused for passwords, leading to poor conclusions about password
  security

#### Example (from textbook)

Let X be a random variable taking values from rolling a fair eight-sided die.
Outcomes X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} all have q<sub>i</sub> = 18

- H(X) = lg(8) = 3 bits.

For a fair six-sided die, q<sub>i</sub> = 16

- H(X) = lg(6) = 2.58 bits.

If the six-sided die instead has outcomes X = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\} with resp.
probabilities 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/32,then
H\{1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16,1/32,1/32\}=1/2·1 + 1/4·2 + 1/8·3 + 1/16·4 + 2(1/32·5)=
1.9375 bits, which, as expected, is less than for the fair die with equiprobable
outcomes.

#### Example (taken from an unnamed website)

E = L×log2(R)

- E is your password entropy
- R is the possible range of character types in your password
- L is the number of characters in your password (its length)

| Example          | Character Range | Password Length | Calculation   | Bits of Entropy |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Bankruptcies     | 52              | 12 chars.       | E = 12 x 5.7  | 68.4            |
| 1Bankruptcies2   | 62              | 14 chars.       | E = 14 x 5.95 | 83.3            |
| 1Bankruptcies2&% | 94              | 16 chars.       | E = 16 x 6.55 | 104.8           |

- Generally, a strong or high-entropy password scores at least 75 bits. Anything
  measuring fewer than 72 bits is reasonably easy for a machine to crack.

#### Why this approach is misleading

- assumes attacker goes through every possible password, methodically
  - in reality, attackers try high probability passwords first
- assumes we know the probability space for passwords (e.g. c1Bkanpurtis2&e% is
  just as probably as 1Bankruptcies2&%)
- in reality, an attacker can use a dictionary, add in capitals, numbers, and
  digits, and get to this guess much faster than the calculated bits of entropy
  would imply
- all the shown passwords are relatively easy to guess

### Password managers

- store passwords
- sync passwords among your devices
- generate random passwords
- autofill passwords
- protected by a _master password_

- security and risks
  - single point of failure
  - master password capture, online guessing, or offline guessing
  - risk if passowrd manager fails

#### Lastpass

![lastpass](/images/notes/lastpass.png)

- puts your master password through a _key derivation function_, PBKDF2, for
  many rounds
- this results in an encryption key that is used to encrypt the password vault,
  using AES
- one more round of the KDF provides the authentication hash
- key point: if an attacker steals your vault (which has happened with
  LastPass), and you used a weak master password, they can brute force that
  password to recover your vault

  [LastPass Technical whitepaper](https://assets.cdngetgo.com/66/f9/14ae54a64706b9ed0ab624479338/lastpass-technical-whitepaper.pdf)
  for more details

#### 1Password

- k = PBKDF2(password, secret_key, 650000)
- mixes a secret key with the password
- to decrypt your vault, you need (a) password, (b) secret key, (c) encrypted
  vault
- prevents a brute-force attack on your vault if it is stolen
- this means you need to store the secret key safely and then enter it to
  authorize a new device to access your vault
- 1Password recommends printing and storing it somewhere (they call this the
  Emergency Kit)

  for more details

#### Academic literature on password managers

- [Why Do People Adopt, or Reject, Smartphone Password Managers?](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08-why-do-people-adopt-or-reject-smartphone-password-managers.pdf)

  - lack of awareness
  - belief that current practices are secure
  - difficulty using or understanding them
  - worry about lack of control

- [Why people (don’t) use password managers effectively](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2019-pearman.pdf)

  - trade-offs between security and convenience (e.g. prioritizing random
    passwords on financial accounts)
  - users of built-in password managers more motivated by convenience (and have
    more re-used passwords), users of separate password managers driven by
    security

- [Why Users (Don’t) Use Password Managers at a Large Educational Institution](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-mayer.pdf)

  - 77% use a password managers, 60% using built-in (browser based), 18% using
    third party
  - 77% reuse passwords across accounts, but those using third party password
    managers are much less likely to do that
  - ease of use more important than security
  - third-party password manager users are significantly more likely to use the
    password manager to generate random passwords

- [That Was Then, This Is Now: A Security Evaluation of Password Generation, Storage, and Autofill in Browser-Based Password Managers](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-oesch_0.pdf)

  - identifies some weaknesses in password managers

- ["Would You Give the Same Priority to the Bank and a Game? I Do Not!" Exploring Credential Management Strategies and Obstacles during Password Manager Setup](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2023/presentation/amft)
  - many using them for convenience, not sucurity
  - users add credentials as they visit websites, and prioritize the sites they
    add
  - users update passwords only when they are considreed insecure
  - distrust of password managers, so some users don't store important passwords
    there
