# Symmetric Encryption

## Ungraded Quiz

- What is the difference between information-theoretic security and
  computational security?

- What is the key space? Why does it need to be large?

- What is the cryptographic key in a Caeasar cipher? How big is the key space?

-

- What is the difference between a block cipher and a stream cipher?

- Why does a block cipher need modes?

## Important note

- You should not design your own cryptographic algorithms and protocols (unless
  you are doing PhD-level research or have become a cryptography expert)

- [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle),
  as restated by Steven Bellovin -- "design your system assuming that your
  opponents know it in detail"

## Key Concepts

Be familiar with diagrams like
[Figure 2.1, page 31](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)

These diagrams use cryptographic notation.

For any given encryption key, you can try to guess it by exhaustively trying all
possible keys -- this is called an _exhaustive key search_ or a \_brute force
search.

- Example: DES keys, 56 bits
- A keyspace of 56 bits provides 2 56 ‚âà 7.2√ó10<sup>16</sup> possible keys. At a
  rate of 10<sup>12</sup> keys per second it would take approximately
  7.2√ó10<sup>4</sup> seconds or about 20 hours to try every key.
- In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation
  collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes.

Attacks:

- A _ciphertext-only_ attack requires the attacker to guess the plaintext (or
  the key) using only the ciphertext.
- A _known-plaintext_ attack means the attacker has access to examples of both
  plaintext and ciphertext.
- A _chosen-plaintext_ attack means the attacker can choose a plaintext and see
  the corresponding encrypted ciphertext.
- A \_chosen-chiphertext\* attack meanst he attacker can choose ciphertext and
  see the corresponding decrypted plaintext.

Adversaries:

- A _passive_ adversary can only observe messages.
- An _active_ adversary can inject or alter messages.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption allows one party to send encrypted data to another party,
provided they have a _shared key_. It is called symmetric encryption because the
same key is used for decryption and encryption.

- If using a random stream of bits for the key, and never reuse the same key,
  this is a _one-time pad_.
- A one-time pad is information-theoretically secure for confidentiality: "even
  given unlimited computing power and time, an attacker without the key cannot
  recover plaintext from ciphertext".
- Useful in theory! Try to approach its level of security.
- In practice, we try to have _computational security_, meaning protection
  against an attacker with fixed resources, unable to brute force keys chosen
  from a large space.
- Has no integrity.

### Types of ciphers

- stream cipher -- encrypt one bit or one character at a time
- block cipher -- encrypt chunks of fixed size, e.g. 128 bits, pad smaller
  blocks with a 1 and then zeroes.

### AES

- AES is the most common block cipher --
  [see Figure 2.3, page 34](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)
- 128-bit block
- 128, 192, or 256 bit key

### Block cipher modes

- block cipher modes are used to encrypt variable-size pieces of data using a
  block cipher

  - ECB
  - CBC
  - CTR

- [Wikipedia article on block cipher modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)

- everywhere you see "block cipher encryption" in the below diagrams, that is
  where AES fits in

### ECB Mode

- Electronic Code Book
- Not recommended due to its weaknesses

![ECB mode encryption](/images/notes/ecb-mode-encryption.png)
![ECB mode decryption](/images/notes/ecb-mode-decryption.png)
![ECB mode patterns](/images/notes/ecb-mode-patterns.png)

### CBC mode

- Cipher Block Chaining
- blocks are chained together
- uses an Initialization Vector to make sure each message is unique, should be
  random
- encryption must be done sequentially by block
- message must be padded to a multiple of the block size

![CBC mode encryption](/images/notes/cbc-mode-encryption.png)
![CBC mode decryption](/images/notes/cbc-mode-decryption.png)

### CTR mode

- CounTeR
- uses a non-repeating counter
- nonce is an initialization vectore
- for a given AES key, do not re-use the same nonce
- the counter is encrypted and then XORed with the plaintext to produce
  ciphertext
- turns a block cipher into a stream cipher, since each bit of the plaintext is
  individually XORed with the encrypted counter
- encryption and decryption can be done in parallel

## The strength of cryptography

- Relies on the size of the key space
- AES typically uses a key space of 256 bits = 2<sup>256</sup> possible keys
- For comparison:
  - 1 in 2<sup>61</sup> odds of winning the lottery and being hit by lightning
    in the same day
  - 2<sup>92</sup> atoms in the average human body
- Thermodynamic limits
  - physics: To set or clear a bit requires no less than ùëòùëá "erg"
    - ùëò is the Boltzman constant -- 1.38√ó10<sup>‚àí16</sup> erg‚ÅÑ¬∞ùêæ
    - ùëá is the absolute temperature of the system
  - assuming ùëá=3.2¬∞ùêæ (ambient temperature of universe)
    - ùëòùëá=4.4√ó10<sup>‚àí16</sup> ergs
  - annual energy output of the sun is 1.21√ó10<sup>41</sup> ergs
    - enough to cycle through a 187-bit counter in a year
    - enough to cycle through a 192-bit counter after 32 years
  - a supernova produces about 10<sup>51</sup> ergs
    - enough to cycle through a 219-bit counter
