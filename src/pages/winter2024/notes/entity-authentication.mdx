# Entity Authentication

## Key Concepts

### Entity Authentication

- Alice and Bob share a key in advance
- Later, how can each side prove that they know the key? For example, if they
  want to prove they really are talking to each other

- A simple method is to use a challenge-response protocol

  - Alice sends a challenge that Bob can only answer if he knows the secret
  - Such a protocol is called a proof of knowledge protocol

- Unilateral: Alice wants Bob to prove he has the secret

- Mutual: Alice and Bob prove to each other they have the secret

### Key Establishment

- How do Alice and Bob establish the secret key in the first place?
- Usually want to establish a session key, meaning a new key for each time you
  talk
  - key transport: one key chooses the key and needs to get it to the other
    party
  - key establishment: derive a shared key using information from both parties
- Generally want to authenticate the other party AND establish a session key all
  at once
- Key management is hard
  - establishing shared keys
  - securing them in transit and storage
