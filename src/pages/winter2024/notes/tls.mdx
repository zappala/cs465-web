# TLS

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The reading today is

## TLS

#### SSL and TLS hsitory

#### SSL record structure

#### TLS handshake and DH key exchange

<Image alt="TLS handshake and key exchange" src={tls_handshake_dh} />

- one of the main purpose of the TLS handshake is to etablish a shared key

  - notice how everything after the key exchange is encrypted and protected with
    a MAC -- this means an attacker cannot modify algorithms chosen
  - can use a _pre-shared key_, meaning a key from a previous session
  - Diffie-Hellman keys are ephemeral -- erased after use

- also need to authenticate the server by having it sign something

- encryption uses _authenticated encryption_ with a MAC

#### Cipher Suite

- defines the algorithms used during the TLS connection

  - key exchange algorithm -- for exchanging/creating a symmetric encryption key
  - authentication algorithm -- for digital signatures
  - bulk encryption algorithm -- for encrypting the data
  - MAC algorithm -- for security

- example: _ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256_

  - ECDHE:
    [Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie–Hellman)
    -- based on [elliptic
    curves](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography
    instead of discrete log
  - ECDSA -- Elliptic-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
  - AES 128 -- AES with 128-bit key
  - GCM -- Galois/Counter Mode -- block cipher with high performance
    (parallelizable) and patent-free
  - SHA256 -- MAC algorithm

- elliptic curve cryptography -- higher security with shorter length keys (but
  not quantum safe)

### Obtaining a certificate for a website

- It used to be expensive to get a certificate for a website
  - You can now get one free with Let's Encrypt
  - It uses a protocol called ACME to automatically verify you own a domain
  - For example, you contact an ACME server to request a certificate, and it
    gives you a file to serve from your website, once it verifies that you are
    serving it, then it issues you the certificate
  - see [Let's Encrypt Stats](https://letsencrypt.org/stats/)
