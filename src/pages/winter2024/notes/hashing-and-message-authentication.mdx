# Hashing and message authentication

## Ungraded Quiz

- Properties of a cryptographic hash function:

  - preimage resistance
  - second preimage resistance
  - collision resistance

- You want to store hashed passwords in a database. What properties do you need?

- You want to compute a digital signature of a hash. What attack can be stopped by a hash functon that has second preimage resistance? What attack can be stopped by a hash function that has collision resistance?

## Key concepts

### Cryptographic hash functions

- [Figure 2.10](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf) shows a cryptographic hash function

- desirable properties:

  - _one-way_ or _preimage resistance_: For any given value h, it is computationally infeasible to find x such that H(x) = h
    - there are actually many inputs that map to a single output (since the output is fixed size), but it is still comptuationally infeasible to find them

  * _second preimage resistance_: For any given block x, it is computationally infeasible to find y â‰  x with H(y) = H(x)
  * _collision resistance_ : it is computationally infeasible to find any pair (x, y) such that H(x) = H(y)

- common cryptographic hash functions -- see [Table 2.1, page 44](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)

- MD5 is deprecated

  - shown to not be collision resistant, so not suitable for digital signatures or TLS certificates
  - also it is fast, which is a bad property for password hashing

- SHA-1 is also deprecated -- discontinued by web browsers in 2017, by Microsoft for Windows Update in 2020

  - shown to not be collision resistant
  - chosen-prefix attack -- given two different prefixes, p1 and p2, attacker can find two suffixes, s1 and s2, such that H(p1 | s1) = hash(p2| s2) -- an attack in 2019 would cost $100,000

- SHA-2 and SHA-3 are considered secure

- Digital signatures

  - typically sign a hash instead of the original message or file
  - hash needs to be collision resistant
  - see [Figure 2.11, page 45](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)

  - see [Hash Functions](https://joyofcryptography.com/pdf/chap11.pdf)

### Message authentication

- covers both integrity of the data and the identity of the party that sent the message
- sender computes and sends a message authentication code (MAC), which the receiver verifies
- does not provide non-repudiation since either party could have created the message and MAC using the shared key
- see [Figure 2.12, page 46)(https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)

- HMAC builds a MAC from a hash function, e.g. HMAC-SHA256

### Authenticated encryption

- _authenticated encryption_: provides both confidentiality and integrity (protecting against message modification and injection that an active attacker may try)
- _authenticated encryption with associated data_: provides additional associated data that is authenticated but not encrypted -- see [Figure 2.13, page 48](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)
- use a special algorithm -- see [Table 2.2, page 49](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf) -- typically AEAD_AES_128_GCM
