# Public Key Encryption

## Ungraded Quiz

- Can you draw a diagram for hybrid encryption?

- Can you show cryptographic notation for the diagram?

## Key Concepts

### Public Key Cryptography

<Image alt="public key cryptography" src={public_key_cryptography} />

- Each party creates a separate _key pair_, (public key, private key).
- If Alice knows Bob's public key, she can encrypt a message using his public
  key (e<sub>B</sub>) and only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key
  (d<sub>B</sub>).
  - c = E<sub>e<sub>B</sub></sub>(m)
  - m = D<sub>d<sub>B</sub></sub>(c)
- Bob _must_ keep his private key secret, otherwise anybody could decrypt his
  messages.
- Standard public key cryptography algorithm is called RSA -- provides
  computational security
- Typically use padding with RSA to turn a deterministic encryption into one
  that incorporates some randomness. A common standard is PKCS\#1 v2.

### Hybrid Encryption

- Usually, we use public key cryptography to _bootstrap_ a shared, symmetric
  key.
- This is because encrypting and decrypting with a symmetric key is much fater
  than encrypting and decrypting with public key cryptography.
- Alice can choose a symmetric key, then encrypt it with Bob's public key and
  send it to him. Now they both have a symmetric key they can use to encrypt and
  decrypt messages to each other.
- See
  [Figure 2.8, page 38](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)
- Alice and Bob can choose a new symmetric key each time they communicate, so we
  call this a _session key_.

### Digital Signatures

<Image alt="digital signatures" src={digital_signatures} />

- Alice can sign (encrypt) a message with her private key (s<sub>A</sub>). Bob
  can verify (decrypt) the message with Alice's public key (v<sub>A</sub>).
  - Here we use (v, s) to represent the (public key, private key).
  - Be sure to use separate keys for encryption/decryption and
    signing/verifying. signing/verifying.
- See
  [Figure 2.9, page 40](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf)
- Digital signatures provide:

  - _data origin authentication_ -- we can verify who signed the message
  - _data integrity_ -- we can verify whether the message is the same as what
    was signed
  - _non repudiation_ -- the signer can't claim they didn't sign the message
    (unless someone stole their private key)

- Use of public key cryptography by the general public is hard because it
  requires you to keep your private key safe and to have a reliable way to
  distribute your public key to others. These are _key management_ issues.

## Exercise

- Draw a diagram that illustrates how to use hybrid encryption and digital
  signatures to send a signed message from Alice to Bob. - Should you
  sign-and-encrypt or encrypt-and-sign? - See
