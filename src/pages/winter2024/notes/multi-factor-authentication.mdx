# Multi-factor authentication

### One-time passwords

- generate a list of passwords, each good for one time only
- useful for recovery codes
- can generate and print/save
- can send via text messages
  - SMS is vulnerable to SIM swapping
- vulnerable to pre-play attacks
- vulnerable to phishing and MITM attacks

#### Lamport hash chains

- developed by [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport), also the inventor of LaTeX, the Paxos consensus algorithm, lots of other stuff
- see [Figure 3.3 and Equation 3.4, page 67](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)
- must be seeded with a shared random number
- work backward from t repeated hashes
- an intercepted password doesn't help the attacker know subsequent passwords because the hash is one-way

#### Passcode generators and TOTP

- see [Figure 3.4, page 69](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)
- requires a secret to be shared
- used as input to a function, along with a challenge
- if the challenge is the current time, this is a time-based one-time password (TOTP) -- very commonly used as a second factor, e.g. Duo, Google Authenticator
  - be sure your TOTP generator backs up the shared secrets, otherwise if you replace your phone, you will have a hard time accessing your accounts!
  - see [RFC 6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) for the TOTP spec
- again, intercepting a password doesn't help the attacker know future passwords

#### Hardware tokens

- USB cards, sart cards, and other physical objects that can securely store secrets and generate tokens for use in a challenge-response protocol
- e.g. can hold an RSA signature key pair
  - A tells B it wants to login using V<sub>A</sub>
  - B sends a random number r<sub>B</sub>
  - A chooses random number r<sub>A</sub> and responds with signature S<sub>A</sub>(r<sub>A</sub>, r<sub>B</sub>)

#### Multiple factors

- see [Figure 3.5, page 70](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)
- different categories are more likely to be independent
- what if you use your phone for everything, including password manager, TOTP or Duo second factor? are you still using MFA?
- when combining factors, their combined security should be stronger than each individually
- when combining factors, inconvenience can add up
- second factors can be triggered by a signal, such as a missing browser cookie, new IP address or location

## Biometric authentication

- advantages -- nothing to carry, no cognitive burden, ease of use, scalability
- disadvantages -- can be compelled or done while sleeping, can't be changed/revoked, can be "stolen", false accepts and rejects
- what you are vs how you act
- not secret! rely on a trusted input channel
- see [Table 3.2, page 72](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)
- enrollment involves identifying features
- login involves creating a matching score, and a threshold
- see [Figure 3.6, page 74](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)
- understand [Figure 3.7, page 75](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf)

## Passwordless FIDO2

- hardware security keys -- see [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com)

  - generate a public/private keypair for each website you use
  - prove ownership of the private key in a challenge

- Passkeys

  - same technology, but keypairs are encrypted and stored in a cloud account, e.g. Apple Keychain
  - similar to a password manager, but for cryptographic keys
  - Apple requires 2FA on your account if you are going to store Passkeys there

  - see [Google](https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/)
  - see [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/) and [About the security of passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)
  - see [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)
  - see [1Password](https://1password.com/product/passkeys)

- Both are resistant to phishing, brute force attacks, password breaches
