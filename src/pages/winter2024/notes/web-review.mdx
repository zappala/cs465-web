## Key Concepts

### DNS

- translates domain names into IP addresses
- a domain name is separated by dots
  - TLDs
  - subdomains

### URLS

- see
  [Figure 9.1, page 247](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)

- well-known ports: FTP (21), SSH (22), SMTP (25), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)

### HTML

- markup for web pages
- links and image tags are important because they contain references to other
  objects
- the browser interprets the HTML as a Document Object Model (DOM)

### Scripts

- can manipulate the document object model (DOM)
- can be embedded or given in a URL
- page loading -- see
  [list on page 248](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)
- pay attention to ways that JavaScript can run on a page
  - in script tags with or without URLs
  - in URLs for links
- JavaScript can set itself to run when the document is loaded or when an object
  is clicked

### HTTP

- HTTP consists of request messages and responses messages
  - GET
  - POST
  - CONNECT
- see
  [Figure 9.2, page 249](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)
- open a web browser and user browser network tools to see live requests

### Web forms

- sent in FORM elements
- may generate a new HTTP request
  - typically a POST request with data in the body
- may be handled by JavaScript

### HTTP Proxies

- originally used as a gateway to the web, to simplify clients
- now also used for caching
- may be invisible (e.g. not requested by the client) for HTTP resources
- HTTP CONNECT method may be used to tunnel through a proxy / firewall

### Browser redirection

- both HTTP and HTML allow a browser to be directed automatically to a new
  resource
- [see list of redirect mechanisms, page 251](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)

### Summary

- walk through all the steps that occur when a browser visits a URL
