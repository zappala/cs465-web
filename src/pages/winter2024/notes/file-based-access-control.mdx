# File-based Access Control

## Key Concepts

### File-based permissions

- Multics and UNIX -- treat every object as a logical file -- e.g. printing to a
  printer is printing to a file
- metadata stores permissions
- access to every object is thus "file permissions"
- ACLs have disadvantages
  - long (consumes memory, time)
  - frequent updates needed
  - tedious
  - [can use these in Linux!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-control-listsacl-linux/)


### ugo

- ugo -- user, group, other
- userID
- groupID
- see /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group
- superuser: userID = 0, root
- fixed length!
- less expressive than ACLs
- see `ls -al`
- see [Table 5.1, page 136](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf)
- initial value for file permissions set by `umask` -- play with this to see how it works
- change permissions using chown, chgrp

###  setuid bit

- [see Figure 5.5, page 135](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf)
- can be set by owner
- means the file, if run, executes with the permissons of the owner, rather than the user running the program
- allows the program to do things the owner can do
- attackers look for programs owned by root with setuid bit set
- if you can find a vulnerability in a root-owned program with setuid bit set, you can do anything on the system
- real
