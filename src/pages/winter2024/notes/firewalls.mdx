# Firewalls

- Defensive technology
- Designed to screen out incoming traffic at the perimeter of an organization's
  network and also authorize outbound traffic

  - but also can be on individual machines

- see
  [Figure 10.1, page 283](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

- note an organization may want to inspect outgoing traffic to ensure sensitive
  data isn't exfiltrated

## Packet-filter firewall

- inspects individual packets using rules
  - often a "match first rule" system
  - actions are ACCEPT, DROP (no notice), REJECT (provide error), LOG
- filter rules usually based on:

  - source IP address
  - source port
  - destinaton IP address
  - destination port
  - protocol

- may also use ICMP type and code
- _stateless_ filters vs _stateful_ filters

  - e.g. can track TCP connection states, treat packets belonging to an accepted
    TCP connection different from new connections

- see
  [Table 10.1, page 285](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf),
  and the text above it explaining each type of rule

- the "perimeter" doesn't take into account personal devices, USB drives, phones

- limitations:
  [see list on page 286](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

- advantages of dedicated firewalls:
  [see list on page 287](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

## Proxy firewalls

- _circuit-level proxy firewalls_: relay an entire connection, either allow or
  deny, and then relay bytes

  - [see Figure 10.2, page 289](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
  - uses a socket daemon, _sockd_, on the firewall, and the SOCKS protocol to
    communicate
  - user --- sockd --- Internet site
  - separate TCP connections!
  - application -> intercepted by SOCKS library -> SOCKS protocol to sockd ->
    internet
  - connection is allowed or disallowed

- _application-level proxy firewalls_: relay application-specific traffic
  - [see Figure 10.3, page 290](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
  - able to inspect contents of packets since they have knowledge of the
    protocol
  - can remove malicious JavaScript, emails, etc.

## Enterprise firewall architectures

- see
  [Figure 10.4, page 292](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
- the firewall (3) is exposed to the hostile newtork, so it maybe called a
  _bastion host_
- the web server and DNS server are public-facing, so they sit on a network
  right after the firewall, in a _demilitarized zone_ or DMZ
- there is a second internal firewall (4) that protects internal assets
- routers (1) and (2) provide connectivity
- provides defense in depth
