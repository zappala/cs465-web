# TLS and cookies

## Key Concepts

### TLS

#### SSL and TLS hsitory

#### SSL record structure

#### TLS handshake and DH key exchange

<Image alt="TLS handshake and key exchange" src={tls_handshake_dh} />

- one of the main purpose of the TLS handshake is to etablish a shared key

  - notice how everything after the key exchange is encrypted and protected with
    a MAC -- this means an attacker cannot modify algorithms chosen
  - can use a _pre-shared key_, meaning a key from a previous session
  - Diffie-Hellman keys are ephemeral -- erased after use

- also need to authenticate the server by having it sign something

- encryption uses _authenticated encryption_ with a MAC

#### Cipher Suite

- defines the algorithms used during the TLS connection

  - key exchange algorithm -- for exchanging/creating a symmetric encryption key
  - authentication algorithm -- for digital signatures
  - bulk encryption algorithm -- for encrypting the data
  - MAC algorithm -- for security

- example: _ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256_

  - ECDHE:
    [Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffieâ€“Hellman)
    -- based on [elliptic
    curves](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography
    instead of discrete log
  - ECDSA -- Elliptic-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
  - AES 128 -- AES with 128-bit key
  - GCM -- Galois/Counter Mode -- block cipher with high performance
    (parallelizable) and patent-free
  - SHA256 -- MAC algorithm

- elliptic curve cryptography -- higher security with shorter length keys (but
  not quantum safe)

### HTTP cookies and DOM objects

- Document Object Model (DOM) is a hierarchical data structure

  - `window.document` -- gives you the DOM
  - `window.location` -- gives you the URL

- cookies
  - HTTP is stateless (every request is independent)
  - cookies provide the state
- cookies are `(key, value)` pairs
  - can be stored in browser memory or persistently
  - set in the `SetCookie` header
- open the browser developer tools, network tab to examine cookies
- important attributes
  - `Max-Age` or `Expires` -- controls lifetime
  - `Domain` -- hosts the cookie is valid for (can't be as broad as a TLD)
  - `Path` -- the file paths the cookie should be used for
  - `Secure` -- cookie will only be sent over HTTPS
  - `HttpOnly` -- only accessible over HTTP and not via DOM through JavaScript
    on the page
