# Midterm Preparation

Topics to study:

- Concepts and principles
  - What are important questions to be considered when performing threat
    modeling?
  - How does risk assessment relate to threat modeling?
  - What are the components of DREAD?
- Crytographic building blocks
  - What is the difference between information-theoretic security and
    computational security?
  - What are the different types of attacks that can be made on a cipher?
  - Why does symmetric encryption use block ciphers?
  - How can two peopele use basic challenge-response to prove ownership of a
    shared symmetric key?
  - How does hybrid encryption work? Explain what each party exchanges using
    cryptographic notation.
  - How do digital signatures work? Explain what each party exchanges using
    crytographic notation.
  - How does Diffie-Hellman establishe a shared key between two people?
  - Explain the properties of a cryptographic hash function.
  - Explain what an HMAC does. Use cryptographic notation to show what one party
    would send to another when using an HMAC.
- User authentication
  - Explain how salting and hashing of passwords works, including what is stored
    in a password database.
  - What are the current NIST recommendations for password composition policies?
    Why have they made these recommendations?
  - Explain how entropy applies to passwords and why it may not accurately
    reflect how people choose passwords.
  - Explain the basics of how a federated identity system works.
  - How does a one-time password generator work? How does a TOTP generator work?
  - Why would a company or a user want to use two-factor authentication?
- Access control
  - Describe the basics of how an operating system provides memory protection
    for processes.
  - Explain how ugo file permissions work in Linux.
  - Explain the purpose of the setuid bit in Linux and how it works.
  - How is Role-Based Access Control different from file-based access control?
    What are its advantages?
- Software security
  - Give an example of a TOCTOU race condition.
  - Give an example of how an integer-based vulnerability.
  - Explain how a basic buffer overflow vulnerability works.
  - Explain how a heap-spraying attack works.
  - How does a canary defend against a stack-based buffer overflow
    vulnerability?
  - How does ASLR defend against a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability?
- Malicious software
  - What is the difference between a virus and a worm?
  - Give an example of a strategy an anti-virus program could use to detect
    malware. Give an example of a counter-attack a virus could use to defeat
    this detection measure.
  - Given Figure 7.5 from the book, explain how inline hooking works.
  - What is a botnet? Give an example of how an attacker can hide its command
    and control infrastructure from legal authorities.
