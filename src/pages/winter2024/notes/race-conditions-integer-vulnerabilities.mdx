# Race Conditions and Integer vulnerabilities

## Ungraded Quiz

1. What is a TOCTOU race? Could you diagram one?
1. Sketch out an integer vulnerability and why it is dangerous

## Key Concepts

- understand why software security is important -- your most likely security-related role if you will be a developer
- the importance of thinking like an attacker if you are a defender

### Race Conditions

- TOCTOU race -- why they occur, how they work
- see [Figure 6.1, page 157](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf) and the subsequent example
- understand what it means to disable interrupts and why this is not a viable method on modern systems
- walking through unsuccessful approaches is useful to understanding offensive and defensive thinking
- understand the example in [Figure 6.2, page 159](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
- understand the `/tmp` file exploits example

### Integer-based vulnerabilities

- due to integer bugs
- related to side-effects of types conversions between different integer types or signedness
- understand why we study C
- understand C data types, unsigned and signed versions
- both implicit and explicit type casting occurs
- understand what integer overflow is
- understand signed vs unsigned numbers
- understand two's complement -- see [Table 6.3, page 164](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
- undersatnd Example on _Integer overflow on multiplication_
- see [Table 6.2, page 163](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf) for examples of integer vulnerabilities
- understand pointer arithmetic and how that can be exploited by integer vulnerabilities
- understand software consequences list, 1 through 4
- mitigations -- compiler flags to catch integer errors, developer toolsets, safe integer library functions
- it would be great to switch to a better language (Rust!) but we have to live with what we have for now
