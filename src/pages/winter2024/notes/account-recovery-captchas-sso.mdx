# Account recovery, CAPTCHAs, and SSO

## Ungraded Quiz

- Why is account recovery important? Why is it problematic?
- How does reCAPTCHA work?
- How does SSO work? Who are the parties? What is the workflow?

## Key concepts

### Account recovery

- _never_ store passwords in the clear so that you can offer "password recovery"
- recovery link or code sent via email
  - difficulty: compromised email account can be use dto take over other accounts
  - see [Email as a Master Key: Analyzing Account Recovery in the Wild](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8486017)
- one-time code sent via SMS
  - difficulty: phones subject to targeted SIM cloning attacks
- challenge questions
  - diffiuclty: users may forget answers, answers may be easily guessed, likely stored in plaintext so can be leaked
  - not recommended
  - see [Secrets, Lies, and Account Recovery: Lessons from the Use of Personal Knowledge Questions at Google](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2736277.2741691)

### CAPTCHA

- used to prevent mass creation of free accounts, spam on discussion boards
- often bsaed on character recognition, audio recognition, image recognition, or cognitive games
- can use as an alternative to rate limiting
- susceptible to AI, human labor pools
- reCAPTCHA ("I am not a robot") measures human interaction with the webpage
- see [Gotta CAPTCHA â€™Em All: A Survey of 20 Years of the Human-or-computer Dilemma](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3477142)

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

- uses an identity provider to issue access tokens for an account held at a relying party
- centralized login, but also concentrated risk

- types of systems

  - credential manager (including password managers)
  - enterprise SSO -- typically used in a corporate environment, e.g. Kerberos, Central Authentication Services (CAS)
  - Federated Identity -- e.g. Google OAtuh or Facebook login

- Federated Identity

  - when logging into a relying party (website), redirected to identity provider
  - user authenticates to identity provider, given a token, and redirected back to original relying party
  - relying party accepts token from identity provider as authenticating the user
  - see [Signing Me onto Your Accounts through Facebook and Google: A Traffic-Guided Security Study of Commercially Deployed Single-Sign-On Web Services](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6234424)
  - see [Towards Automated Auditing for Account and Session Management Flaws in Single Sign-On Deployments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9833753)

- Kerberos

  - uses a centralized key distribution center (KDC), called T
  - enables mutual authentication between client A and server B
  - see the exchange in the [middle of page 114](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch4-rev1.pdf)
    - A authenticates to T, receives an encrypted ticket it can give to B, plus a secret key for communicating with B, k<sub>s</sub>. The ticket contains the secret key, but encrypted for B.
    - A can now give the ticket to B, plus prove that it knows the secret key k<sub>s</sub>
    - B then authenticates to A that it knows the secret key k<sub>s</sub>

- This is a simplified version of Kerberos, there are _many_ more details
