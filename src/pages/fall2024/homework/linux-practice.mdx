# Homework: Linux Practice

For this homework, you're going to use Docker to run a Ubuntu container and then
practice using the Linux command line.

## Docker setup

(1) Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

You may need to create a Docker account when you run Docker Desktop.

Once you have Docker Desktop running, you're going to use a terminal for the
following commands. You can use a Mac terminal (I recommend
[iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)), WSL on Windows, or the terminal that is built
into DOcker Desktop (see bottom right of the window).

(2) Verify you can use docker on the command line:

```
docker version
```

(3) Get the Docker container from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull zappala/linux-land
```

(4) Run the Docker container:

```
docker run -d -p 2222:22 --name lotr zappala/linux-land
```

This runs the container and maps port 22 (used for ssh) to port 2222 and also
gives the container the name `lotr`.

(5) Find the IP address of your Docker container:

```
docker inspect lotr | grep IPAddress
```

(6) Use `ssh` to login to the Linux image.

There are two accounts set up on this image: `root` (password tolkien) and
`bilbo` (password ring):

```
ssh -p 2222 bilbo@localhost
```

## Linux command line

Use the [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) site to complete the
following sections:

- Command Line
- Text-Fu
- User Management
- Permissions
- Processes

For each section, run all the commands they show you, and play around. Create
directories and files. Add a new user. Change permissions on files.

Note, the following commands will not work:

- man: because man pages are not installed
- whatis: because man pages are not installed
- sudo: use root account instead

You can use Google to find the appropriate man pages as needed.

Finally, I recommend using `useradd` to add an account as shown. Try using `ssh`
to connect to that account with the password you create. What happens? Then
create an account using `useradd -m -s /bin/bash arwen`. Why does this work
better?

## Grading

Homework is graded on a participation basis. Turn in this homework if you:

- Have run the Docker setup and logged into the machine.
- Have run at least 80% of the commands given

Note, if you are already a master with Linux (e.g. you have used it for several
years on a personal machine), then review all the material but you may skip
anything you already know. If you don't know Docker, be sure to at least try
that part.
