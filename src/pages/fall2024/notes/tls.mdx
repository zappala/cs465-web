## TLS handshake and DH key exchange

- the main purpose of the TLS handshake is to etablish a shared key
- note this shows Diffie-Hellman, but there are a variety of ways to complete
  the handshake

![TLS handshake and key exchange](/images/notes/tls-handshake-dh.png)

- parts of the handshake

  - Client Hello
    - Random client: random number used later to derive shared key
    - Cipher Suites: zero or more
    - Session ID: can be used to update or resume a connection
  - Server Hello
    - Random server: random number used later to dervice shared key
    - Cipher Suite: the single cipher suite selected from the client's list (or
      the connection is closed if none is available)
    - Session ID: can indicate a resumed connection or a new connection
  - Server Certificate
    - a chain of certificates that authenticate the server to the client
  - Server Key Exchange
    - random client from above
    - random server from above
    - signed Diffie-Hellman parameters
  - Server Hello Done
    - empty, signals end of key exchange messages
    - note, this is needed because, e.g. Server Key Exchange message may not be
      needed
  - Client Key Exchange
    - public Diffie Hellman message
  - Change Cipher Spec
    - potentially multiple messages to change the cipher suite
  - Finished

    - sent after cipher change messages
    - verifies the key exchange and authentication was successful
    - contains some data to verify the previous exchanges -- HMAC of master
      secret, a text string, hash of hasndshake messages
    - first message protected with the negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets
    - after this message, the peers can exchange data

  - everything after the key exchange is encrypted and protected with a MAC
    (unless AES GCM mode used) -- this means an attacker cannot modify
    algorithms chosen
  - can use a _pre-shared key_, meaning a key from a previous session
  - Diffie-Hellman keys are ephemeral -- erased after use

## TLS Cipher Suites

- defines the algorithms used during the TLS connection

  - key exchange algorithm -- for exchanging/creating a symmetric encryption key
  - authentication algorithm -- for digital signatures
  - bulk encryption algorithm -- for encrypting the data
  - MAC algorithm -- for security

- example: _ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256_

  - ECDHE:
    [Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffieâ€“Hellman)
  - ECDSA -- Elliptic-curve Digital Signature Algorithm
  - AES 128 -- AES with 128-bit key
  - GCM -- Galois/Counter Mode -- block cipher with high performance
    (parallelizable) and patent-free
  - SHA256 -- MAC algorithm

## Organization and Extended Validation certificates

types of certificates

- DV (Domain Validated) certificates
  - demonstrate control of the domain, which could be responding to email sent
    to `admin@domain.com`
  - inexpensive or free
- OV (Organization Validated) certificates
  - manual checks to certify ownership of a real-world organization
- EV (Extended Validation) certificates verify
  - real-world existance of a legal entity in the `Subject`
  - registration in government-recognized databases
  - physical existence matching location in certificate
  - identity of person requesting certificate and their relationship to the
    organization
  - control of the domain
- IV (Individual validated) certificates

  - user decided to trust them (e.g. self-signed certificates)

- **users don't know the difference between DV, OV, and EV**

  - thus not very useful

  - see
    [An Evaluation of Extended Validation and Picture-in-Picture Phishing Attacks](https://www.adambarth.com/papers/2007/jackson-simon-tan-barth.pdf)
    -- study showing Internet Explorer EV certificate interface didn't help
    users identify phishing attacks
  - can't prove a CA takes these validation steps anyway

## Attacks on TLS

- rogue certificates -- see
  [Hackers spied on 300,000 Iranians using fake Google certificate](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2510951/hackers-spied-on-300-000-iranians-using-fake-google-certificate.html),
  2011

- TLS stripping attacks -- block the signal to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS

  - see website configuration below
  - use browser tools to see the redirect
  - see HTTPS Everywhere browser extension
  - revocation failures can be exploited

- difficulties with browser trust model

  - how do users or browsers decide who is trustworthy and who is not?
  - poor trust agility -- no system to dynamically add/remove certificates from
    the root store, it's up to the OS or browser vendor
  - intermediate CAs are unaccountable -- can only remove root CAs

- certificate transparency helps expose rogue certificates

  - this uses a blockchain to track all certificates
  - an attacker can avoid putting a rogue certificate into the blockchain, but
    then browsers will reject it as not valid
  - an attacker can put the rogue certificate into the blockchain, and then once
    caught the signing CA will be banned
  - so the system helps shorten the lifetime of attacks

## Other TLS topics

- TLS flaws are serious

  - a bug in TLS affects massive amounts of ecommerce
  - see
    [Heartbleed 101](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876249)
    and the included xkcd comic

- the widespread use of CDNs for content delivery means CDNs have wbesite
  private keys
  - see
    [Content Delivery Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/configure/configure-cdn)
    for a good picture of a CDN
  - see
    [Measurement and Analysis of Private Key Sharing in the HTTPS Ecosystem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2976749.2978301)
