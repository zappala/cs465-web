# Multi-factor authentication

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 3](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf),
sections 3.4, 3.5

## One-time passwords

- generate a list of passwords, each good for one time only
  - useful for recovery codes
  - can generate and print/save
  - can send via text messages
    - SMS is vulnerable to SIM swapping
- disadvantages
  - vulnerable to pre-play attacks
  - vulnerable to phishing and MITM attacks

## Lamport hash chains

- developed by [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport),
  also the inventor of LaTeX, the Paxos consensus algorithm, lots of other stuff

![Lamport hash chains](/images/security-book/figure-3.3.png)

![Lamport hash chain details](/images/security-book/equation-3.4.png)

- must be seeded with a shared random number
- work backward from _t_ repeated hashes
- an intercepted password doesn't help the attacker know subsequent passwords
  because the hash is one-way

## Passcode generators and TOTP

![passcode generators](/images/security-book/figure-3.4.png)

- requires a secret to be shared
- used as input to a function, along with a challenge
- if the challenge is the current time, this is a time-based one-time password
  (TOTP) -- very commonly used as a second factor, e.g. Duo, Google
  Authenticator
  - be sure your TOTP generator backs up the shared secrets, otherwise if you
    replace your phone, you will have a hard time accessing your accounts!
  - see [RFC 6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238) for the TOTP
    spec
- again, intercepting a password doesn't help the attacker know future passwords

## Hardware tokens

- USB cards, sart cards, and other physical objects that can securely store
  secrets and generate tokens for use in a challenge-response protocol
- e.g. can hold an RSA signature key pair
  - A tells B it wants to login using V<sub>A</sub>
  - B sends a random number r<sub>B</sub>
  - A chooses random number r<sub>A</sub> and responds with signature
    S<sub>A</sub>(r<sub>A</sub>, r<sub>B</sub>)

## Biometric authentication

- "something you are" instead of "something you know" or "something you have"

![types of biometric authentication](/images/security-book/table-3.2.png)

- advantages -- nothing to carry, no cognitive burden, ease of use, scalability
- disadvantages -- can be compelled or done while sleeping, can't be
  changed/revoked, can be "stolen", false accepts and rejects

- should never be used for remote login
  - biometrics are not secret -- can easily be captured by someone
  - need a trusted input channel or can be easily spoofed
  - if biometric patterns are stored remotely, then they can be stolen
  - biometrics can't be changed if stolen
- useful for local login
  - unlocking a smartphone or laptop
  - unlocking a password manager or banking app
- system must be tuned based on false accepts and false rejects

![tuning a biometric system baed on false rejects and false accepts](/images/security-book/figure-3.6.png)

- usually require a fallback in case of failure (e.g. a password)

- a variety of attacks possible (from
  [Biometrics: a tool for information security](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1634356))

![possible attacks on a biometric system](/images/notes/jain-figure9.png)

### Multiple factors

![multi-factor authentication](/images/security-book/figure-3.5.png)

- important principles

  - different categories are more likely to be independent
  - when combining factors, their combined security should be stronger than each
    individually
  - when combining factors, inconvenience can add up

- second factors can be triggered by a signal, such as a missing browser cookie,
  new IP address or location

- what if you use your phone for everything, including password manager, TOTP or
  Duo second factor? are you still using MFA?

## Passwordless FIDO2

- hardware security keys -- see [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com)

  - generate a public/private keypair for each website you use
  - prove ownership of the private key in a challenge

- Passkeys

  - same technology, but keypairs are encrypted and stored in a cloud account,
    e.g. Apple Keychain
  - similar to a password manager, but for cryptographic keys
  - Apple requires 2FA on your account if you are going to store Passkeys there

  - see [Google](https://safety.google/authentication/passkey/)
  - see [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/) and
    [About the security of passkeys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102195)
  - see
    [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/passkeys-in-windows-301c8944-5ea2-452b-9886-97e4d2ef4422)
  - see [1Password](https://1password.com/product/passkeys)

- Both are resistant to phishing, brute force attacks, password breaches

## Extra Reading

### Biometrics

- see
  [An Introduction to Biometric Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1262027),
  Jain, Ross, Prabhakar, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video
  Technology, 2004 for an overview of the technology

- see
  [Liveness is Not Enough: Enhancing Fingerprint Authentication with Behavioral Biometrics to Defeat Puppet Attacks](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-wu.pdf),
  Wu, He, Chen, Zhao, and Du, USENIX Security 2019.

_Fingerprint authentication has gained increasing popularity on mobile devices
in recent years. However, it is vulnerable to presentation attacks, which
include that an attacker spoofs with an artificial replica. Many liveness
detection solutions have been proposed to defeat such presentation attacks;
however, they all fail to defend against a particular type of presentation
attack, namely puppet attack, in which an attacker places an unwilling victimâ€™s
finger on the fingerprint sensor. In this paper, we propose FINAUTH, an
effective and efficient software-only solution, to complement fingerprint
authentication by defeating both synthetic spoofs and puppet attacks using
fingertip-touch characteristics. FINAUTH characterizes intrinsic fingertip-touch
behaviors including the acceleration and the rotation angle of mobile devices
when a legitimate user authenticates. FINAUTH only utilizes common sensors
equipped on mobile devices and does not introduce extra usability burdens on
users. To evaluate the effectiveness of FINAUTH, we carried out experiments on
datasets collected from 90 subjects after the IRB approval. The results show
that FINAUTH can achieve the average balanced accuracy of 96.04% with 5 training
data points and 99.28% with 100 training data points. Security experiments also
demonstrate that FINAUTH is resilient against possible attacks. In addition, we
report the usability analysis results of FINAUTH, including user authentication
delay and overhead._
