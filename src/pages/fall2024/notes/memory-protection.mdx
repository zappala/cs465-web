# Memory Protection

## Key Concepts

- We are making the transition to Operating Systems security.
- Will be focusing on fundamentals, with examples from Linux and Multics
- Why Multics? Really influential!

> "Multics is the first major operating system to be designed as a secure system
> from the outset."

- discussing operating systems with multiple users, and multiple processes per
  user

### Isolation

- Two proceses, sharing the same computer system -- need to be sure they can't
  access each others' memory! Otherwise, _nothing_ is safe.
- Started with three components:
  - _descriptor register_: which addresses a process can access
  - _privileged bit_: when set, can change the descriptor register contents, can
    only be used by _supervisor_
  - _supervisor_: special process that is in charge of the system
  - strict isolation, without sharing

### Segment addressing + access permissions

- divides memory into segments, each one with access permissions for read,
  write, execute, mode (e.g. supervisor or user), fault
- start of virtual memory -- the same physical address can be mapped to multiple
  processes, each with different segment identifiers and access permissions
- see
  [Figure 5.2, page 129](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf)

### Accountability

- each user of the system gets a separate username, password, user ID
- processes also get identifiers
- need to keep track of everything, e.g. for billing purposes

### Roles

- e.g. user, administrator
- often change usernames when changing roles
- bad practice to share username among people (e.g. sudo, root)
- better to use role-based access control (RBAC, see section 5.7)

### Reference monitor

- need to defend against malicious users
- every access by a program to any memory is validated against a list of
  permitted uses, based on the user and the program function
- uses an _access matrix_ of all subject/object pairs and their associated
  permissions
- see
  [Figure 5.4, page 131](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch5-rev1.pdf)
- typically implemented as a monitor per class of object
- must be:
  - tamper-proof
  - not circumventable
  - verifiable by analysis and tests
- called a _security kernel_
- difficult to implement in practice -- see the discussion on dependencies
- if you focus on subjects and what they can do -- you get _capability lists_
- if you focus on objects and what is allowed -- you get _access control lists_
- _audit trails_ allow you to inspect what happened, after the fact

### Aside

This, about Multics, is pretty incredible. See
[Multics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics).

> Multics also supports extremely aggressive on-line reconfiguration: central
> processing units, memory banks, disk drives, etc. can be added and removed
> while the system continues operating. At the MIT system, where most early
> software development was done, it was common practice to split the
> multiprocessor system into two separate systems during off-hours by
> incrementally removing enough components to form a second working system,
> leaving the rest still running for the original logged-in users. System
> software development testing could be done on the second system, then the
> components of the second system were added back to the main user system,
> without ever having shut it down. Multics supports multiple CPUs; it is one of
> the earliest multiprocessor systems.
