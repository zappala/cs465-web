# Certificates

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 8](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf),
sections 8.0-8.3, 8.5.

## Public key certificates

- a _public key certificate_ associates a public key with an owner

  - combination of Subject and public key signed by a Certification Authority
    (CA)
  - a _relying party_ relies on this certification authority and trusts its
    signature

- we typically use a set of standards from the International Telecommunication
  Union (ITU) -- X.509

## Issuing a certificate

- _Certificate Authorities (CAs)_ can issue certificates for humans, computers

  - web: issue to a web server to certify a public key is associated with a
    hostname
  - email: issue to a person to certify a public key is associated with an email
    address
  - code signing: issue to an organization to certify a public key is associated
    with that organization (name, location, company officer)

- evidence needed to issue a certificate include

  - ownership of the key using challenge/response
  - ownershp or control of the entity in the Subject field (email address, web
    server, organization)
  - affiliation with a named legal entity

- can easily get a website certificate for free with
  [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

  - It uses a protocol called ACME to automatically verify you own a domain
  - For example, you contact an ACME server to request a certificate, and it
    gives you a file to serve from your website, once it verifies that you are
    serving it, then it issues you the certificate
  - see [Let's Encrypt Stats](https://letsencrypt.org/stats/)

## Verifying a certificate

- anyone can sign their own certificate, called a _self-signed certificate_
  - but it won't necessarily be trusted!
- the web uses a CA-based trust model:

![Browser trust model](/images/security-book/figure-8.7.png)

- we use a trust model that assumes some trust anchors (trusted certificates)
  are shipped with browsers and operating systems
  - called a _trusted certificate store_ or _root store_
- each CA can forms a root of trust
- other trust models are possible! the book covers some of them

![verifying a certificate](/images/security-book/figure-8.2.png)

- Validating a certificate chain

  - obtain a certificate chain
    - you may have only the leaf or you may be given a partial chain
    - trace signatures back to a root and look up certificates as needed
  - for each certificate
    - check that it is not expired and is current
    - check that it is not revoked (see below)
    - check that the signature is valid using the signing CA's public key
    - use is consitent with constraints (see below)
    - subject name matches semantics
      - hostname signed is the hostname the user is visiting in the browser
      - email address that is signed is the email subject
    - signing CA either has a public key that is trust anchor, or repeat above
      steps until reaching a trust anchor

- constraints
  - basic constraints
    - includes whether the public key is for a CA (and thus can sign other
      certificates), otherwise it is a leaf certificate
    - includes a chain length, 0 means the CA can only issue leaf certificates
  - key usage
    - allowed uses, e.g. for signatures, encyption, key agreement, revocation
      list signatures, code signing
  - subject alternate name
    - various alternative aliases (other email addresses, other domain names or
      IP addresses)
  - name constraints
    - constrains what a CA can sign for (e.g. only .com or only .byu.edu
      domains)

## Revoking a certificate

- needed in case

  - a private key is stolen
  - a private key is lost
  - changes to name or organization
  - new key pair

- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

  - issued by a CA
  - contains a list of all unexpired but revoked certificates
  - can be fetched by a browser / RP periodically
  - major drawback is size, especially for mobile devices

- Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

  - allows a browser / RP to check the revocation status of a certificate
  - major downside is privacy concern
    - CAs now have knowledge of your browsing habits
    - note, ISPs already have this
  - another major concern is "failing open"
    - if fetching OCSP status fails, the browser still visits the site
      (otherwise users are unhappy)
    - this makes it easy for an attacker to deny access to OCSP and thus carry
      out an attack with a revoked certificate
  - another concern is delay
  - _OCSP stapling_
    - a web server gets a signed, timestamped certificate of the validity of the
      certificate
    - provides this to the web browser when fetching its certificate
    - eliminates the delay concern
    - stapling can still be deleted/removed by an attacker, leading to the
      "failing open" problem
    - web sites can use "OCSP must staple" in their certificates, indicating
      that if the staple is stripped, that is a problem
    - attacker can still strip it and cause denial of service
    - website owners can mess it up and cause outage for customers

- current approach is to use compressed CRLs or CRL sets

  - see [CRLsets](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/crlsets/) from
    Google
  - see
    [CRLite](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/01/09/crlite-part-1-all-web-pki-revocations-compressed/)
    from Mozilla

- not clear whether mobile devices use revocation at all

## PKI

- _public key infrastructure_ (PKI) is used for managing public keys, private
  keys, and their use

![elements of a PKI](/images/security-book/figure-8.1.png)

- includes all aspects of using public key cryptography, from generation, to
  bootstrapping session keys, certificates, revocation
- several challenging elements

  - long term storage of private keys is challenging
    - particularly for individuals
    - critical websites may use offline storage, but many use online storage
    - backup and recovery typically needed
  - revocation (see above)
  - public key distribution and verification for people (websites use the CA
    hierarchy)

## Alternatives to the web model

- Signal
  - verify public keys using an out-of-band channel
  - most users have no idea this exists or what it is for

![signal key verification screens](/images/notes/signal-key-verification.png)

- Web of Trust / PGP

  - sign keys of people you meet and verify, perhaps at key signing parties
  - pass these along to your friends
  - decide individually who you trust
    - just those you verified yourself
    - friends of friends
    - friends of friends of friends?
  - generally a failure

- Trust on First Use (TOFU)
  - accept a public key the first time you get it
  - look for _key continuity_, e.g. warn users if keys change so they can verify
  - [autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/index.html) appears to be making some
    progress putting this into open source email systems
  - TOFU is also often used with SSH servers

## Class Exercise

- use Chrome to inspect website certificates
