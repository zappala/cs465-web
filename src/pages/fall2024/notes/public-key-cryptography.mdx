sections 2.3, 2.4

## Public Key Cryptography

![public key cryptography](/images/notes/public-key-cryptography.png)

- Each party creates a separate _key pair_, (public key, private key). These are
  also called the encryption key and decryption key.
- If Alice knows Bob's public key, she can encrypt a message using his public
  key (e<sub>B</sub>) and only Bob can decrypt the message using his private key
  (d<sub>B</sub>).
  - c = E<sub>e<sub>B</sub></sub>(m)
  - m = D<sub>d<sub>B</sub></sub>(c)
- Bob _must_ keep his private key secret, otherwise anybody could decrypt
  private messages sent to him.
- Standard public key cryptography algorithm is called RSA -- provides
  computational security
- Typically use padding with RSA to turn a deterministic encryption into one
  that incorporates some randomness. A common standard is PKCS\#1 v2.

## Hybrid Encryption

Usually, we use public key cryptography to _bootstrap_ a shared, symmetric key.
This is because encrypting and decrypting with a symmetric key is much faster
than encrypting and decrypting with public key cryptography.

- Alice chooses a symmetric key, then encrypts it with Bob's public key and
  sends it to him. Now they both have a symmetric key they can use to encrypt
  and decrypt messages to each other.
- Alice and Bob typically choose a new symmetric key each time they communicate,
  so we call this a _session key_.

## Digital Signatures

We can also use public key cryptography to implement digital signatures. Here,
private key is used to sign and the public key is used to verify. Note that
signing uses encryption and verifying uses decryption.

![digital signatures](/images/notes/digital-signatures.png)

- Alice signs (encrypts) a message with her private key (s<sub>A</sub>). Bob can
  verify (decrypt) the message with Alice's public key (v<sub>A</sub>). Here we
  use (v, s) to represent the (public key, private key).
- Be sure to use separate keys for encryption/decryption and signing/verifying.
  signing/verifying.

![digital signatures vs encryption](/images/security-book/figure-2.9.png)

- Digital signatures provide:

  - _data origin authentication_ -- we can verify who signed the message
  - _data integrity_ -- we can verify whether the message is the same as what
    was signed
  - _non repudiation_ -- the signer can't claim they didn't sign the message
    (unless someone stole their private key)

- Use of public key cryptography by the general public is hard because it
  requires you to keep your private key safe and to have a reliable way to
  distribute your public key to others. These are _key management_ issues.

## Hybrid encryption with integrity

![hybrid encryption with integrity](/images/notes/hybrid-encryption-with-integrity.png)

- A digital signature of a hash of the message ensures Bob knows the message
  came from Alice the message hasn't been altered.
- AES with GCM provides integrity and, assuming only Alice and Bob know the
  symmetric key, then assures Bob that Alice sent the message.
- Getting all the pieces right is tricky. See
  [Defective Sign & Encrypt in S/MIME, PKCS\#7, MOSS, PEM, PGP, and XML](https://theworld.com/~dtd/sign_encrypt/sign_encrypt7.html).
  Use TLS where possible.

## Extra reading

- The [Marvin attack](https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/)
  - _**Stop using RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption!** On the TLS level, only servers
    that enable RSA encryption are affected. Most modern clients support the use
    of Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman, thus disabling ciphersuites that use RSA
    encryption is the recommended way to fix this vulnerability._

## Class exercises

We are using the [Rust Crypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto) crates.

See the [Rust Cryptography](https://github.com/BYU-CS465/rust-cryptography) repo
for [RSA](https://docs.rs/rsa/latest/rsa/index.html) code examples.
