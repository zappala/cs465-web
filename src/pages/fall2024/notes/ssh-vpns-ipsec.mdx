# SSH, VPNs, and IPSec

## SSH

- provides an encrypted _tunnel_ between two hosts
  - typically, we think of a tunnel as a way to connect two machines over a
    network that doesn't support the service we want
  - in this case, ssh provides an `encrypted connection` for remote access, over
    an unencrypted network
- we used to have cleartext utilities for working with remote hosts, and now
  there are encrypted equivalents,
  [see Table 10.2, page 293](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

- [see Figure 10.5, page 293](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
  for an illustration of how SSH provides a tunnel between a client `ssh` and a
  server `sshd`

  - the applications on the remote host do not need to be "ssh-aware"

- protocols

  - _transport protocol_: authentication, encryption, integrity, negotiates
    parameters and keys
  - _user authentication protocol_: handles user authentication, runs on top of
    the transport protocol
  - _connection protocol_: enables multiple logical connections over a single
    physical connection, also runs over the transprt protocol

- user authentication

  - password
  - Kerberos ticket
  - client public key

- public key authentication

  - client sends public key and signature over data, including session ID
  - public key must be pre-registered as an authorized key
  - signature must be valid
  - session data must match
  - you should setup public key authentication when you use ssh and you should
    put a password on your private key

- SSH server authentication

  - outside of busineses, we often use TOFU (trust on first use) for a server
    key
    - can verify a hash of the fingerprint if you can get a valid hash over an
      independent channel -- not done in practice
  - in enterprises, use a CA model, with a CA managed by the enterprise

- SSH port forwarding

  - [see Figure 10.6, page 295](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

- How scp works

  - [see Figure 10.7, page 296](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

- old model of trusted logins illustrates the dangers of transited trust

## VPNs

- Virtual Private Network

- want to extend a private network (home or enterprise) to other locations
- [see Figure 10.8, page 298](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
- can use hosts or gateways as endpoints,
  [see FIgure 10.9, page 299](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
- encrypted tunnels make it difficult for an enterprise to filter malicious
  content, catch data exfiltration, block unwanted protocols or sites

## IPsec

- provide security at the network layer,
  [see Figure 10.10, page 300](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)

- used for VPNs

- Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

  - automated key exchange using Diffie-Hellman, plus parameter negotiation
  - security association (SA) - shared state of algorithms, sequence numbers,
    cryptographic keys

- Authentication Header (AH)

  - used for authentication only (no encryption)
  - see
    [Figure 3.11, page 301](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
    - remember, the IP header contains a Protocol field, this field is set to
      IPsec, so the receiving router knows that it will next see an AH
    - the Next Header field tells what protocol comes next in the payload, e.g.
      TCP
    - the SPI is an index to the SA that was created

- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

  - used for confidentiality in addition to authentication
  - see
    [Figure 3.12, page 301](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
  - Next Header indicates what type of protocol was encrypted (e.g. TCP or IP)

- small differences in transport mode vs tunnel mode,
  [see Figure 3.13, page 302](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf)
  - note that in tunnel mode, the IPsec payload includes an IP header -- this is
    to send the packet to the host after exiting the tunnel, which terminates at
    a router
