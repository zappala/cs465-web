# SSH, VPNs, and IPSec

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 10](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf),
sections 10.3 - 10.5.

## SSH

- provides an encrypted _tunnel_ between two hosts
  - typically, we think of a tunnel as a way to connect two machines over a
    network that doesn't support the service we want
  - in this case, ssh provides an `encrypted connection` for remote access, over
    an unencrypted network
- we used to have cleartext utilities for working with remote hosts, and now
  there are encrypted equivalents:

- high level overview of ssh:

- protocols

  - _transport protocol_: authentication, encryption, integrity, negotiates
    parameters and keys
  - _user authentication protocol_: handles user authentication, runs on top of
    the transport protocol
  - _connection protocol_: enables multiple logical connections over a single
    physical connection, also runs over the transprt protocol

- user authentication

  - password
  - Kerberos ticket
  - client public key

- public key authentication

  - client sends public key and signature over data, including session ID
  - public key must be pre-registered as an authorized key
  - signature must be valid
  - session data must match
  - you should set up public key authentication when you use ssh and you should
    put a password on your private key

- SSH server authentication

  - outside of busineses, we often use TOFU (trust on first use) for a server
    key
    - can verify a hash of the fingerprint if you can get a valid hash over an
      independent channel -- not done in practice
  - in enterprises, use a CA model, with a CA managed by the enterprise

<Image alt="SSH port forwarding" src={figure_10_6} />

- you are used to using `ssh` to manually make a connection, but it can also be
  set up as a tunnel:

  - forward all traffic going to specific local port to a remote host and port
  - e.g. send all traffic destined for port 2000 on my machine to a remote
    machine port 25 (email)
  - benefit: traffic is encrypted while it is in transit
  - benefit: the applications on the local and remote host do not need to be
    "ssh-aware"

- How scp works:

<Image alt="how scp works" src={figure_10_7} />

- old model of trusted logins illustrates the dangers of transited trust
  - used to have a file of trusted hosts in `/etc/hosts.equiv`
  - if you are authenticated as a user on a trusted host, you can log into this
    machine as that same user with no authentication!

## VPNs

- Virtual Private Network

- want to extend a private network (home or enterprise) to other locations with
  an encrypted tunnel:

<Image alt="encrypted tunnel" src={figure_10_8} />

- can use hosts or gateways as endpoints:

<Image alt="types of VPNs" src={figure_10_9} />

- encrypted tunnels make it difficult for an enterprise to filter malicious
  content, catch data exfiltration, block unwanted protocols or sites

## IPsec

- provide security at the network layer:

<Image alt="where IPsec fits in the network stack" src={figure_10_10} />

- used for VPNs

- Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

  - automated key exchange using Diffie-Hellman, plus parameter negotiation
  - shared state between endpoints is called a security association (SA) -
    algorithms, sequence numbers, cryptographic keys

- Authentication Header (AH)

<Image alt="Authentication Header" src={figure_10_11} />

- used for authentication only (no encryption)

  - remember, the IP header contains a Protocol field, this field is set to
    IPsec, so the receiving router knows that it will next see an AH
  - the Next Header field tells what protocol comes next in the payload, e.g.
    TCP
  - the SPI is an index to the SA that was created

- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

<Image alt="Encapsulating Security Payload" src={figure_10_12} />

- used for confidentiality in addition to authentication

  - Next Header indicates what type of protocol was encrypted (e.g. TCP or IP)

- small differences in transport mode vs tunnel mode:

<Image alt="transport mode vs tunnel mode" src={figure_10_13} />

- note that in tunnel mode, the IPsec payload includes an IP header -- this is
  to send the packet to the host after exiting the tunnel, which terminates at a
  router
