# Web Background

## URLS

![parts of a URL](/images/security-book/figure-9.1.png)

## HTTP

![HTTP protocol](/images/security-book/figure-9.2.png)

- HTTP consists of request messages and responses messages

  - GET: fetch a resource
  - POST: create a resource
  - PUT: update a resource
  - DELETE: delete a resource

- open a web browser and user browser network tools to see live requests

## HTML

- markup for web pages
- links and image tags are important because they contain references to other
  objects

```html
<a href="url">text</a>

<img src="url" />
```

- the browser interprets the HTML as a Document Object Model (DOM)

## Cookies

- cookies
  - HTTP is stateless (every request is independent)
  - cookies provide the state
- cookies are `(key, value)` pairs
  - can be stored in browser memory or persistently
  - set in the `SetCookie` header
- open the browser developer tools, network tab to examine cookies
- important attributes
  - `Max-Age` or `Expires` -- controls lifetime
  - `Domain` -- hosts the cookie is valid for (can't be as broad as a TLD)
  - `Path` -- the file paths the cookie should be used for
  - `Secure` -- cookie will only be sent over HTTPS
  - `HttpOnly` -- only accessible over HTTP(S) and not via DOM through
    JavaScript on the page

## JavaScript

- runs on the client's computer in the browser
- can manipulate the document object model (DOM)!
  - any script can go through the DOM and change any elements in it
  - `window.document` -- gives you the DOM
  - `window.location` -- gives you the URL
- can be embedded in a web page or loaded as a separate resource

- when a page is loaded, the browser executes JavaScript found in the DOM using
  this process:

  - Execute all JavaScript code in the order it is encountered. This includes
    `<script>` tags and any HTML elements using a `src` attribute that inject a
    JavaScript file.
  - Any script may call `document.write()` or other functions to modify the DOM.
    Once a script finishes, the browser continues parsing the DOM. This may
    include parsing newly created parts of the DOM from the just-finished
    script.
  - After finishing parsing, execute JavaScript when an event handler fires. The
    `onload` event fires after the document is parsed, all script blocks have
    run, and all external resources have loaded. Other events may be `onclick`.
  - A URL may also use the `javascript:` scheme. In this scheme, the URL may
    contain JavaScript code in one or more semicolon-separated statements. Any
    return value is the body of the new document. This scheme can be in any URL,
    including the `href` attribute or as the `action` attribute in a `<form>`
    tag.

```html
<a href="javascript: stmt1 ; stmt2 ; void 0; ">Click me</a>
```

## Browser redirection

- Redirection causes the browser to visit a new URL

- JavaScript redirection

```javascript
window.location = "url";
window.location.href = "url";
```

- HTML redirection after `N` seconds

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="N; URL=new-url" />
```

- HTTP response header redirection after `N` seconds

```
Refresh: N; url=new-url
```

- HTTP response header redirection, for status code 3XX

```
Location: url
```

## Summary

- walk through all the steps that occur when a browser visits a URL
  - DNS lookups
  - certificate verificaction for HTTPS connections
  - parse HTML, creating a DOM
  - run Javascript, potentially modifying the DOM
