# Learning Rust 2

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Learning Rust, Section 6

We are using [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

### Enums

You can declare enumerated types:

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

...and then create instances of those types:

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

You can include data in enumerated types:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

You can even mix types:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

### Option

`Option` is an numerated type in the standard library, letting you define a
variable as being something or nothing.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

See this amazing quote from Tony Hoare, who invented `null`:

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first
> comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My
> goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with
> checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist the
> temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to
> implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system
> crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
> the last forty years.

```rust
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_char = Some('e');

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```

> Rust forces you to allow for the possibility that something may be null, and
> then handle the case when it is null.

### match

The `match` expression lets you handle different cases for an enumerated type:

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}
```

### Exercises

You are now ready to do the `rustlings` for section 8.

## Learning Rust, Section 7

### Packages and Crates

- A crate can be a binary crate or a library crate.

- A package contains one or more crates.

- A package can contain/create many binary crates but only one library crate.

### Modules

See the
[modules cheat sheet](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html#modules-cheat-sheet)
to see how Rust uses modules to organize source code.

- Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default.
- You can declare modules and functions public.

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

Note, you need to declare the `hosting` module public and the
`add_to_waitlist()` function public so that you can use them in the parent
module.

### Use keyword

The `use` keyword brings paths into scope:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

The above is the _idiomatic_ way to bring in a module -- keep the module name
instead of bringing the function into scope.

Here is the _idiomatic_ way to bring in a struct:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert(1, 2);
}
```

### External packages

To use an external package, list the package in your `Cargo.toml`:

```rust
rand = "0.8.5"
```

Then use it:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
}
```

### Separating modules

You can
[separate modules in to different file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html#separating-modules-into-different-files)
and follow some Rust conventions. For example:

`src/lib.rs`:

```rust
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

`src/front_of_house.rs`:

```rust
pub mod hosting {
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
}
```

### Exercises

You are now ready to do the `rustlings` for section 10.

## Learning Rust, Section 9

### Vectors

Rust has support for vectors:

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```

You can iterate over them:

```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
    *i += 50;
}
```

### Strings

A variety of ways to initialize a string:

```rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = "initial contents".to_string();

// this also works
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

You can add to a string:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```

Strings can store UTF-8 characters:

```
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
```

This means a string is not just a simple storage of one byte per character.

### Exercises

You are now ready to do the `rustlings` for sections 5 and 9.
