# Operating Systems Background

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/),
an open source textbook. You shoud have read these sections:

- [Processes](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-intro.pdf)
- [CPU Scheduling](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-sched.pdf)
- [Address Spaces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/vm-intro.pdf)

## Key concepts

- Processes

  - processes enable the OS to provide the illusion that the system has an
    unlimited number of CPUs available, enabling many programs to run
    "simultaneously"
  - a process is a running program: state (registers, stack), memory (address
    space), I/O
  - the OS provides an API so that programs can create, destroy, wait for, and
    control processes
  - processes have a stack and a heap
  - a process can be in a variety of states, e.g. ready, running, blocked (e.g.
    waiting for I/O)
  - the OS keeps track of a process using a data structure

- CPU scheduling

  - scheduling algorithm: the part of the OS that decides which process runs and
    for how long
  - can measure effectiveness of a scheduling algorithm with metrics, e.g.
    turnaround time (time completed - time arrived) or response time (time first
    run - time arrived)
  - see the book diagrams for turnaround time for different scheduling
    algorithms
  - First In, First Out (FIFO) -- can lead to long turnaround times if there are
    long-running processes
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Shortest Time-to-Completion First (STCF)
  - Round Robin -- better for response time
  - modern schedulers are much more complex -- see multi-level feedback queue in
    next chapter

- Address spaces
  - the pictures are particularly heplful for this chapter
  - early systems let a process use all physical memory not in use by the OS
  - modern systems use multi-programming, allowing multiple proceses to be in
    memory at a time
  - each process gets its own virtual address space, with the OS mapping the
    virtual numbers to physical space
  - the OS swaps memory in and out of physical space based on what the running
    process needs
  - the OS uses memory protection so that processes cannot access memory from
    another process

## Class Exercises

Clone the
[OS homework repo](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-homework/).

### Processes

Use `cd cpu-intro` to get to the appropriate directory.

This is meant to show you VERY basic CPU scheduling and the how the OS wants
balance I/O and CPU.

Run the process simulator from the end of the
[Processes](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/cpu-intro.pdf) chapter. The
`-l` flag provides a set of jobs of the form `X:Y`, where `X` is the number of
instructions and `Y` is the percent chance that an instruction is CPU not IO.
The `-c` flag computes how the CPU would alternate among proceses, and `-p`
prints statistics.

```bash
# two jobs, 5 instructions each, 100% chance each instruction is CPU computation
python process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100
```

Instructions about the CPU scheduling are at the end. Figure out what it will
do, then run:

```
python process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p
```

Repeat with:

```bash
# two jobs, first has 4 CPU instructions, second has 1 IO instruction
python process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0

# switches the order of the two processes above
python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100

# tells the CPU to swap in another ready process if one is blocked on I/O
python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO

# four processes, first uses I/O, next three use CPU
# tells the CPU that if a job finishes its I/O, it is at the back of the ready queue
python process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER

# same as above, except rtells the CPU that if a job finishes its I/O, it is at the front of the run queue
python process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE
```

### CPU Scheduling

Use `cd cpu-sched` to get to the appropriate directory.

```bash
# three jobs, length 300, 200, 100, FIFO scheduling
python scheduler.py -l 300,200,100 -p FIFO -c

# three jobs, length 300, 200, 100, SJF scheduling
python scheduler.py -l 300,200,100 -p SJF -c

# three jobs, length 300, 200, 100, RR scheduling
python scheduler.py -l 300,200,100 -p RR -c

# three jobs, length 300, 200, 100, RR scheduling, quantum of 10 for the scheduler
python scheduler.py -l 300,200,100 -p RR -c -q 10
```

### Address spaces

- Connect to a Linux VPS (e.g. one running on Amazon or Digital Ocean)

- Look at the
  [man page for `free`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html).

- Run:

```bash
# free memory in mebibytes
free -m
# free memory in "human format"
free -h
```

- Look at the
  [man page for `pmap`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmap.1.html)

- Run:

```bash
# find the process ID of nginx
ps -aux | grep nginx
# use pmap on it
sudo pmap 831
sudo pmap -x 831
```
