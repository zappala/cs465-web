# Password authentication

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 3](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch3-rev1.pdf),
sections 3.0 - 3.2, 3.6, 3.8.

## Password authentication

- **Never store passwords as cleartext -- if your password database is stolen,
  the attacker now knows all passwords and can try them on other sites**

  - instead store hash of the password, using a cryptographic hash function

- basic operation
  - generate a random salt
  - generate a hash of the password and salt hash = H(password, salt)
  - store username, salt, hash
  - note, often the hash includes an encoded salt to simplify storage

## Attacks on passwords

- offline vs online attacks

  - offline -- steal a password database (username, salt, hash), try to crack
    them, usually using a GPU
  - online -- guess passwords on a live system

- rainbow table attack

  - user a list of potential passwords (possibly from a breach list)
  - pre-compute hashes for a well-known hashing algorithm
  - steal a password database
  - compare pre-computed hashes to the password database
  - fast attack since precomputation used
  - foiled by use of salt, which is why salting is so important

- dictionary attack

  - use a list of potential passwords (possibly from a breach list)
  - for each password, compute the hash for each user, using their salt
  - look for a match
  - computation must be done separately for each user since they each have a
    different, randoms salt
  - no precomputation can be done since salts not known in advance

- password capture

  - shoulder-surfing
  - keyloggers
  - malware
  - phishing
  - social engineering

- password interface bypass

- defeating recovery mechanisms

## Password policies

- policies recommended by
  [NIST guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html), see
  [3.1.1.2](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#passwordver)

  - minimum length of 8, should use minimum length of 15
  - accept all printable characters
  - check registered passwords against blocklists
  - rate limit password guessing
  - could also use a pepper -- like a salt, but stored separately, e.g. in an
    HSM (hardware security module)

- policies no longer recommended by NIST, see
  [Appendix A](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html#appA) for helpful
  details

  - password complexity requirements (users will just make "Password1!")
  - password should not arbitarily expire -- only expire if evidence of a
    compromise exists
  - hints that are available to an unauthenticated user

> Length and complexity requirements beyond those recommended here significantly
> increase the difficulty of using passwords and increase user frustration. As a
> result, users often work around these restrictions counterproductively. Other
> mitigations (e.g., blocklists, secure hashed storage, machine-generated random
> passwords, and rate limiting) are more effective at preventing modern
> brute-force attacks, so no additional complexity requirements are imposed.

Notice that this shifts the burden from the user to the system

## Recommended hashing algorithsm

- Argon2id

  - Argon2 -- resists GPU cracking attacks (because it slows them down)
  - Argon2i -- resists side-channel attacks
  - Argon2id -- combines them both

- scrypt if Argon2id is not available
- bcrypt only for legacy systems
- PBKDF2 for FIPS-140 compliance (cryptographic modules)

- see the
  [OWASP password storage cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

## Entropy

- user chosen passwords are not random
- entropy is often misused for passwords, leading to poor conclusions about
  password security

### Bad example (taken from an unnamed website)

E = L×log2(R)

- E is your password entropy
- R is the possible range of character types in your password
- L is the number of characters in your password (its length)

| Example          | Character Range | Password Length | Calculation   | Bits of Entropy |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Bankruptcies     | 52              | 12 chars.       | E = 12 x 5.7  | 68.4            |
| 1Bankruptcies2   | 62              | 14 chars.       | E = 14 x 5.95 | 83.3            |
| 1Bankruptcies2&% | 94              | 16 chars.       | E = 16 x 6.55 | 104.8           |

- Generally, a strong or high-entropy password scores at least 75 bits. Anything
  measuring fewer than 72 bits is reasonably easy for a machine to crack.

#### Why this approach is misleading

- assumes attacker goes through every possible password, methodically
  - in reality, attackers try high probability passwords first
- assumes users choose passwords randomly from the entire password space (e.g.
  c1Bkanpurtis2&e% is just as probably as 1Bankruptcies2&%)
- in reality, an attacker can use a dictionary, add in capitals, numbers, and
  digits, and get to this guess much faster than the calculated bits of entropy
  would imply
- all the shown passwords are relatively easy to guess

## Password managers

- features
  - store passwords
  - generate random passwords
  - autofill passwords
  - sync passwords among your devices
- protected by a _master password_

- security and risks
  - single point of failure
  - master password capture, online guessing, or offline guessing
  - risk if password manager fails

### Lastpass

![lastpass](/images/notes/lastpass.png)

- puts your master password through a _key derivation function_, PBKDF2, for
  many rounds
  - this results in an encryption key that is used to encrypt the password
    vault, using AES
  - one more round of the KDF provides the authentication hash
- key point: if an attacker steals your vault (which has happened with
  LastPass), and you used a weak master password, they can brute force that
  password to recover your vault

- see
  [LastPass Technical whitepaper](https://assets.cdngetgo.com/66/f9/14ae54a64706b9ed0ab624479338/lastpass-technical-whitepaper.pdf)
  for more details

### 1Password

- uses an additional secret key that is mixed with the password

  - k = PBKDF2(password, secret_key, 650000)
  - to decrypt your vault, you need (a) password, (b) secret key, (c) encrypted
    vault
  - prevents a brute-force attack on your vault if it is stolen

- this means you need to store the secret key safely and then enter it to
  authorize a new device to access your vault

  - 1Password recommends printing and storing it somewhere (they call this the
    Emergency Kit)

- see
  [1Password Security Design](https://1passwordstatic.com/files/security/1password-white-paper.pdf)
  for more details

### Password policies and system administrators

- see
  [An Administrator's Guide to Internet Password Research](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/lisa14/lisa14-paper-florencio.pdf)
  -- note, predated NIST by 6 years

### Password alternatives

- [The Quest to Replace Passwords](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6234436)
  - considers security, usability, and deployability

> Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits:
> none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already
> provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor
> security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant
> security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult
> to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction
> because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world

### password managers

- [Why Do People Adopt, or Reject, Smartphone Password Managers?](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08-why-do-people-adopt-or-reject-smartphone-password-managers.pdf)

  - lack of awareness
  - belief that current practices are secure
  - difficulty using or understanding them
  - worry about lack of control

- [Why people (don’t) use password managers effectively](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2019-pearman.pdf)

  - trade-offs between security and convenience (e.g. prioritizing random
    passwords on financial accounts)
  - users of built-in password managers more motivated by convenience (and have
    more re-used passwords), users of separate password managers driven by
    security

- [Why Users (Don’t) Use Password Managers at a Large Educational Institution](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22-mayer.pdf)

  - 77% use a password managers, 60% using built-in (browser based), 18% using
    third party
  - 77% reuse passwords across accounts, but those using third party password
    managers are much less likely to do that
  - ease of use more important than security
  - third-party password manager users are significantly more likely to use the
    password manager to generate random passwords

- [That Was Then, This Is Now: A Security Evaluation of Password Generation, Storage, and Autofill in Browser-Based Password Managers](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20-oesch_0.pdf)

  - identifies some weaknesses in password managers

- ["Would You Give the Same Priority to the Bank and a Game? I Do Not!" Exploring Credential Management Strategies and Obstacles during Password Manager Setup](https://www.usenix.org/conference/soups2023/presentation/amft)

  - many using them for convenience, not sucurity
  - users add credentials as they visit websites, and prioritize the sites they
    add
  - users update passwords only when they are considreed insecure
  - distrust of password managers, so some users don't store important passwords
    there
