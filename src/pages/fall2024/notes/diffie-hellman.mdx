# Key Establishment

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Key Establishment

- Important question -- how do Bob and Alice create a key that they share?

- They could share the key in person, e.g. using a USB drive.
- Alice could generate a key and then encrypt it with Bob's public key

  - If someone records the conversation and then steals Bob's private key, they
    can decrypt everything

  - If you do have a shared key, it is important to prove ownership
    - encrypt a random number
    - encrypt a sequence number
    - encrypt a timestamp
  - All of these prevent a replay attack

- _Key agreement protocol_ -- both parties contribute some information to derive
  a shared key
  - the generated key is ephemeral -- used only for a short time, destroyed
    after use
  - no long term secrets -- so even if an attacker steals Bob's private key and
    has a record of the conversation, they can't compute the derived key

## Diffie Hellman

- "allows two parties with no prior contact nor any pre-shared keying material,
  to establish a shared secret by exchanging numbers over a channel readable by
  everyone else." Pretty amazing!

- Diffie-Hellman protocol
  - _g_ and _p_ are fixed and known for all users
    - _p_ is prime
    - _g_ is a
      [primitive root modulo _p_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n)
    - for every integer _a_ in _g_ that is coprime to _p_, there is some integer
      _k_ for which _g<sup>k</sup> ≡ a (mod p)_
    - _g_ is a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo _p_
  - A : chooses a private value, _a_ in the range [1, p - 2]
  - A → B : g<sup>a</sup> mod p
  - B : chooses a private value _b_ in the range [1, p - 2], computes _K =
    (g<sup>a</sup>)<sup>b</sup> mod p_
  - B → A : g<sup>b</sup> mod p
  - A: computes _K = (g<sup>b</sup>)<sup>a</sup> mod p_
  - depends on _g<sup>ab</sup> = g<sup>ba</sup>_

- Computing a from g<sup>a</sup> and public parameters _g_ and _p_ is called the
  discrete logarithm problem -- computationally difficult if _p_ is chosen with
  certain properties

- Once you derive DH key K, you put it into a _key derivation function_ to get
  the actual key used.

- Textbook DH is unauthenticated -- an active attacker can easily subvert it.

- The STS protocol, discussed in the book, adds digital signatures to DH. We
  will later see DH in TLS.

## Key authentication properties and goals

- forward secrecy -- disclosure of a long-term secret does not compromise the
  secrecy of session keys used for earlier sessions

- known-key security -- compromised session keys do not allow later
  impersonation or compromise future session keys

- entity authentication and liveness -- if you verify an entity is actively
  participating in a protocol, this gives you _liveness_

- key-use confirmation -- you can verify a party has a session key without
  verifying who they are

- implicit authentication -- encrypting a session key using RSA -- you know the
  other party is the only one that can get the session key, but you don't know
  if they have received it

- implicit authentication + key-use confirmation = explicit authentication

- if you want to see details, study the STS implementation details, then read
  through the informal explanation of the properties provided
