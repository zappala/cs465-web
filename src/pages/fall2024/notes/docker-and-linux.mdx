# Docker and Linux

## Introductions

- introductions of two to three students

## Docker

We will use the
[Linux Practice](https://cs465.zappala.org/fall2024/homework/linux-practice/)
homework to show you how to get started with Docker containers.

## Linux

- Quick survey on Linux background for the class:

  - 1: Newbie
  - 2: Some exposure
  - 3: Lots of exposure
  - 4: Use it every day

- Review of the [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) materials.

## Dockerfile

- Dockerfile for Alpine Linux and bash:

```
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk update && apk add bash
```

Then:

```
docker build -t alpine_linux .
docker run -it alpine_linux /bin/bash
```

- Dockerfile used to build the image for the homework

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04


# install ssh
RUN apt update && apt install -y openssh-server
# install needed packages
RUN apt install -y less


RUN mkdir /var/run/sshd
# Set root password for SSH access (change 'your_password' to your desired password)
RUN echo 'root:tolkien' | chpasswd
RUN sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
RUN sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin without-password/PermitRootLogin yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# setup bilbo user
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash bilbo
RUN echo "bilbo:ring" | chpasswd

EXPOSE 22
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
```

## Discussion

- How does the command line give you access to basic OS functionality?
  - file system
  - access control
  - processes
