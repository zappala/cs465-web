# Denial of Service and address resolution attacks

## Denial of Service

- deny legitimate users access to a service by degrading performance or causing
  failure
- floding attacks exhaust resources -- network bandwidth, CPU, memory, disk
  space
- motives

  - financial gain via extortion
  - commercial competitive gain by a competitor
  - activism
  - information warfare
  - hacker experimentation / ego boost
  - vengeance

- distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack

  - may use a botnet
  - may spoof source addresses

- [see examples, page 321](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf),
  covering DoS by poison packets, SYN flooding

- see description of UDP and ICMP floods
- [see example of smurf attack](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf)

- key concept: amplification

## Defenses

- ingress filtering and egress filtering
  - e.g. drop packets sent to broadcast addresses
  - e.g. filter out packets not originating from accepted hosts
- disabling unused services
- rate limiting of ICMP responses
- patching software that is vulnerable
- upstream filtering by ISPs protects against DoS attacks

## DNS attacks

- affects both DNS and ARP
- [see Figure 11.7, page 326](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf))
  for an example of a DNS query resolution

- pharming attack -- falsifies name to address resolution
- attack vectors

  - local host file
  - tampering at intermediate servers
  - network-based response alteration

- DNS cache poisoning
  - queries sent with a random ID
  - a response should carry the same ID
  - an attacker who can guess an ID (e.g. if not properly randomized) can send a
    response to a cache, e.g. using a spoofed source address, and get the DNS
    cache to cache the bad response
- a general defense is DNSSEC, but its deployment has been slow

## ARP attacks

- [see Figure 11.8, page 328](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf)
  for an overview of an ARP attack

  - false ARP replies that are cached
  - the problem is that replies are not authenticated

- defense
  - static, read-only tables
  - cross-checking ARP responses
  - firewalls
