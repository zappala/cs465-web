# App privacy

## Reading

- **Spend 20 minutes per paper**

  - Read the abstract and introduction
  - Understand
    - What is the problem they are trying to solve?
    - What did they do?
    - What did they find?
  - Skim the results looking for main findings or takeaways
  - Read the discussion section or recommendations, if any

- [50 Ways to Leak Your Data: An Exploration of Apps' Circumvention of the Android Permissions System](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/reardon)

  - Note: I recommend you watch the talk for this one instead of reading the
    paper

- [Can you pay for privacy? Consumer expectations and the behavior of free and paid apps](https://btlj.org/data/articles2020/35_1/07_Bamberger_WEB.pdf)
  - Note: This is an article in a law journal, so it is a different format. But
    the same guidelines apply as listed above.
