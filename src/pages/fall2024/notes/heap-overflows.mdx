# Heap Overflows

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html]),
[Chapter 6](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf),
sections 6.4.

## Heap-based buffer overflow attacks

- Dangerous when the heap is both writeable and executable
- see Figure 6.6 to understand why an attacker writing to the heap is dangerous

- see Figure 6.7 for an example of overwriting a function pointer:

![corrupting a function pointer](/images/security-book/figure-6.7.png)

- understand the types of state that can be corrupted
  - jump table -- see below
  - `setjump` -- seee
    [Wikipedia page on setjump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp.h)

```c
MyJump(int c)
{
   switch(state)
   {
      case 0:
         goto func0label;
      case 1:
         goto func1label;
      case 2:
         goto func2label;
   }
}
```

- understand exploit steps

- understand elements of a heap spraying attack -- see Figure 6.8:

## Class exercises

See the [software security repo](https://github.com/BYU-CS465/software-security)
for code we will use:

- In `heap-overflow` we will run `heap` and `heap2`, which both have a heap
  overflow problem. In the first case we will try to change the role of a user,
  and in the second case we will try to change a function pointer. We'll use the
  `exploit.py` script to help create the overflow and accomplish our goal.
