# Symmetric Encryption

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 2](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf),
sections 2.0 - 2.2

## Cryptography basics

### Important note

- You should not design your own cryptographic algorithms and protocols (unless
  you are doing PhD-level research or have become a cryptography expert)

- [Kerckhoffs's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle),
  as restated by Steven Bellovin -- "design your system assuming that your
  opponents know it in detail"

### Cryptographic notation

You should become accustomed to cryptographic notation such as is used below.

<Image alt="cryptographic notation" src={figure_2_1} />

The importance of notation is that it cleary expresses a set of cryptographic
operations. As you read academic papers or cryptography websites, you will find
that there is no _standard_ notation -- instead, an author will often define
their terms before using them.

### Attacks on cryptography

For any given encryption key, you can try to guess it by exhaustively trying all
possible keys -- this is called an _exhaustive key search_ or a _brute force
search_.

- Example: DES keys, 56 bits
- A keyspace of 56 bits provides 2 56 ‚âà 7.2√ó10<sup>16</sup> possible keys. At a
  rate of 10<sup>12</sup> keys per second it would take approximately
  7.2√ó10<sup>4</sup> seconds or about 20 hours to try every key.
- In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation
  collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes.

Some common attacks:

- A _ciphertext-only_ attack requires the attacker to guess the plaintext (or
  the key) using only the ciphertext.
- A _known-plaintext_ attack means the attacker has access to examples of both
  plaintext and ciphertext.
- A _chosen-plaintext_ attack means the attacker can choose a plaintext and see
  the corresponding encrypted ciphertext.
- A _chosen-chiphertext_ attack means the attacker can choose ciphertext and see
  the corresponding decrypted plaintext.

Some common adversaries:

- A _passive_ adversary can only observe messages.
- An _active_ adversary can inject or alter messages.

## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption allows one party to send encrypted data to another party,
provided they have a _shared key_. It is called symmetric encryption because the
same key is used for decryption and encryption.

### Caesar Cipher

Caesar cipher with a shift of 23:

<Image alt="caesar cipher with a shift of 23" src={caesar_cipher} />

- Plaintext: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
- Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

### Vernam cipher

<Image alt="Vernam cipher" src={figure_2_2} />

- If using a random stream of bits for the key, and never reuse the same key,
  this is a _one-time pad_.
- A one-time pad is information-theoretically secure for confidentiality: "even
  given unlimited computing power and time, an attacker without the key cannot
  recover plaintext from ciphertext".
- Useful in theory! Try to approach its level of security.
- In practice, we try to have _computational security_, meaning protection
  against an attacker with fixed resources, unable to brute force keys chosen
  from a large space.
- Has no integrity.

### Types of ciphers

- stream cipher -- encrypt one bit or one character at a time
- block cipher -- encrypt chunks of fixed size, e.g. 128 bits, pad smaller
  blocks with a 1 and then zeroes.

## AES

AES is the most common block cipher.

<Image alt="AES cipher" src={figure_2_3} />

- 128-bit block
- 128, 192, or 256 bit key

### Block cipher modes

Block cipher modes are used to encrypt variable-size pieces of data using a
block cipher. Remember, AES can only encrypt 128 bits! Block cipher modes are
what you use to encrypt larger sizes of data.

Everywhere you see "block cipher encryption" in the below diagrams, that is
where AES fits in

### ECB Mode

- Electronic Code Book
- Not recommended due to its weaknesses

<Image alt="ECB mode encryption" src={ecb_mode_encryption} />
<Image alt="ECB mode decryption" src={ecb_mode_decryption} />
<Image alt="ECB mode patterns" src={ecb_mode_patterns} />

### CBC mode

- Cipher Block Chaining
- blocks are chained together
- uses an Initialization Vector to make sure each message is unique, should be
  random
- encryption must be done sequentially by block
- message must be padded to a multiple of the block size

<Image alt="CBC mode encryption" src={cbc_mode_encryption} />
<Image alt="CBC mode decryption" src={cbc_mode_decryption} />

### CTR mode

- CounTeR
- uses a non-repeating counter
- nonce is an initialization vectore
- for a given AES key, do not re-use the same nonce
- the counter is encrypted and then XORed with the plaintext to produce
  ciphertext
- turns a block cipher into a stream cipher, since each bit of the plaintext is
  individually XORed with the encrypted counter
- encryption and decryption can be done in parallel

<Image alt="CTR mode encryption" src={ctr_mode_encryption} />
<Image alt="CTR mode decryption" src={ctr_mode_decryption} />

### Padding

Block ciphers require that the plaintext be a multiple of the block size (ECB
and CBC modes). Padding is used to make sure that all blocks are ‚Äúfull‚Äù. Both
sides need to know the padding scheme.
[PKCS #7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS) is a common scheme.

## AES with GCM

Symmetric encryption offers confidentiality, but not integrity and authenticity.
Securely combining separate confidentiality and authentication block cipher
operation modes can be error prone and difficult. To solve this problem, we have
_Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)_ algorithms, which provide
confidentiality, integrity, and authentication with associated (unencrypted)
data (e.g. message header). Integrity covers the associated data as well.

AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) is used in TLS, SSH, IPSec, OpenVPN.

<Image alt="AES GCM Wikipedia block diagram" src={aes_gcm_wikipedia} />

- notice that this is identical to CTR mode, with the Associated Data (called
  Auth Data here) added in later
- to add in the associated data, GCM uses a combination of XOR and
  mult<sub>H</sub>, which is finite field multiplication using a
  [Galois Field](https://murshedsk135.medium.com/introduction-to-galois-fields-exploring-aes-fields-and-finite-field-arithmetic-10c5f5c30b76#:~:text=Galois%20Fields%2C%20also%20known%20as,most%20widely%20used%20block%20ciphers.)
- fast, patent-free, on-line (don't need to know message length in advance), can
  be parallelized
- security depends on choosing a unique initialization vector for every
  encryption performed with the same key

## The strength of cryptography

- Relies on the size of the key space. AES typically uses a key space of 256
  bits = 2<sup>256</sup> possible keys
- For comparison:
  - 1 in 2<sup>61</sup> odds of winning the lottery and being hit by lightning
    in the same day
  - 2<sup>92</sup> atoms in the average human body
- Thermodynamic limits
  - physics: To set or clear a bit requires no less than ùëòùëá "erg"
    - ùëò is the Boltzman constant -- 1.38√ó10<sup>‚àí16</sup> erg‚ÅÑ¬∞ùêæ
    - ùëá is the absolute temperature of the system
  - assuming ùëá=3.2¬∞ùêæ (ambient temperature of universe)
    - ùëòùëá=4.4√ó10<sup>‚àí16</sup> ergs
  - annual energy output of the sun is 1.21√ó10<sup>41</sup> ergs
    - enough to cycle through a 187-bit counter in a year
    - enough to cycle through a 192-bit counter after 32 years
  - a supernova produces about 10<sup>51</sup> ergs
    - enough to cycle through a 219-bit counter
