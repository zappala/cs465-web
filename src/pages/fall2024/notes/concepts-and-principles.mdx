# Concepts and Principles

## Ungraded Quiz

Talk to your neighbor:

1. Define confidentiality, integrity, and availabilty. Give one example of when you might want each of these properties in your use of the Internet.

1. What is the difference between authentication and authorization? Give an example of when this difference might be important to you if you were the owner of a website.

1. What threats do you face to your personal computing devices (laptop, phone)? Who is the adversary? What is their goal?

1. What is the purpose of risk assessment?

1. Consider [Figure 1.4, page 11](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch1-rev1.pdf). How does this compare to the software development process you have experienced in classes at BYU? If you have had an internship or job in a software industry, how does this compare to the software development process you experienced at work?

## Key Concepts

### Fundamental goals of security

- Ultimate goal: Help users complete their desired task safely and without
  short- or long-term risk

- CIA triad

  - confidentiality
  - integrity
  - availability

- AAA security

  - authentication
  - authorization
  - accounting

### Terminology

- assets -- what we want to protect, can be physical or virtual

- policy -- what the system is supposed to do and what it should _not_ do

- adversary -- entity who wishes to violate a system's policy to take
  unauthorized action on a target asset, also called threat agent/actor

- attack -- a violation of a security policy by an adversary

- threat -- any combination of circumstances that _might_ allow harm to an asset

- threat/attack vector -- a specific set of steps taken to attack a system

- mitigation -- steps taken to reduce the likelihood of an attack or lesson the
  damage from an attack that succeeds

### Risk assessment

- Calculates the expected loss due to an attack.

- Risk = likelihood \* impact

  - likelihood = P(attack) \* P(vulnerability)
  - impact = cost (tangible and intangible)

- Hard to get numbers that are credible

- Risk assessment questions

  1. What assets are most valuable, and what are their values?
  2. What system vulnerabilities exist?
  3. What are the relevant threat agents and attack vectors?
  4. What are the associated estimates of attack probabilities, or frequencies?

### Modeling Adversaries

Consider:

- who are they?
- what are their objectives?
- what are their methods?
- what are their capabilities?

Examples:

- foreign intelligence
- cyber terrorists
- industrial spy
- organized crime
- crackers
- malicious insiders
- non-malicious employees

### Security Analysis

- Open-ended activity to identify vulnerabilities and design defenses

- See
  [Figure 1.4, page 11](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch1-rev1.pdf)

Key points:

- security analysis must be done throughout the software lifecycle
- a formal security analysis can be done once a product is developed, to review
  against security standards (either from industry or government)
- penetration testing can be done once a product is deployed

## DREAD risk assessment model

Rate the following from 1 to 3 (Low, Medium, High):

- D = damage -- how bad would an attack be?

- R = reproducability -- how easy is it to reproduce an attack?

- E = exploitability -- how much work is it to launch the attack?

- A = affected users -- how many people will be impacted?

- D = discoverability -- how easy is it to discover the attack?

Example payroll application, malicious user views confidential on-the-wire
payroll data

| Factor | Score | Reason                                                |
| ------ | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| D      | 3     | payroll data is extremely sensitive                   |
| R      | 3     | 100% reproducible                                     |
| E      | 2     | Must be on the application's subnet                   |
| A      | 3     | Affects everyone                                      |
| D      | 3     | Easy for attacker to identify that you are vulnerable |

Score: 14

How bad is it?

- 5 - 7: low risk
- 8 - 11: medium risk
- 12 - 15: high risk

Lots of criticism, because scores can be subjective and can vary based on
individual perspectives.

## Exercises

### Security Policies

Discuss with a neighbor and then with the class:

- Smart home
- Bank website

### Risk Assessment

Fill out a DREAD table with your neighbor and then discuss with the class:

- Smart home

  - You have a smart home system that can be unlocked by an app (e.g. you have a
    family member who forgot their key)
  - There is a vulnerability in the smart home provider's server that controls
    access to your home

- Bank website
  - A customer's password is easy to guess
