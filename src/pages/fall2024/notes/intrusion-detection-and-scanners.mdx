# Intrusion detection and scanners

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 10](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch10-rev1.pdf),
sections 11.0 - 11.3.

## Intrusion detection

- try to identify unauthorized or malicious traffic
- _intrusion detection system_

  - monitors events
  - logs related data
  - analyzes data
  - reports events requiring human attention

- _intrusion prevention system_

  - includes active responses
  - alter packets, strip out malware, reset TCP connections, terminate processes
  - real-time

- may monitor processes, programs, commands, data at rest, network packets
- need to collect evidence for a forensic process

- network-based IDS

  - examines packets, e.g. at a router

- host-based IDS

  - examines events on a system, such as application logs, filesystem changes,
    system calls, CPU usage

![IDS event outcomes](/images/security-book/figure-11.1.png)

- true positive, false positive (false alarm)
- true negative, false negative (intrusion missed)

- example
  - imagine we have 100 packets that are OK
    - if system has a false positive for 1 out of 100, then FPR = 1/100 = 1%
    - we could say this system is 99% accurate
  - imagine that out of 100,000 packets we expect 1 to be malicious
    - given FPR of 1%, then there will be 1,000 false positives and 1 true
      positive
    - would you now say the system is 99% accurate?
  - precision = TP/(TP + FP) = 1/(1,000 + 1) = 0.1%
    - 99.9% of alarms are false alarms
    - exploring false alarms steals expert time

## Approaches to intrusion detection

![approaches to intrusion detection](/images/security-book/table-11.1.png)

- signature-based
  - signatures usually automatically updated from vendor
  - may look at behavior (effects of the attack) as well
- specification-based
  - define what is allowed for a protocol or application
- anomaly-based
  - measure normal behavior
  - classify anything else as an anomaly
  - often uses machine learning
  - challenges
    - feature selection
    - intruder-free training
    - session creep (intruders slowly adding themselves)

## Sniffers

- to look at network traffic, need to capture packets and examine them at line
  speed
- helpful even outside of intrusion detection
- also used by attackers!

![hub vs switch](/images/security-book/figure-11.3.png)

- because a hub broadcasts traffic, every host on the LAN sees all the traffic

- network cards can be put into promiscuous mode to sniff traffic

## Vulnerability assessment tools

- explore weaknesses in your systems so that you can modify / update them for
  increased security

  - vulnerability assessment -- examines systems for vulnerability
  - penetration testing -- tries to exploit a vulnerability
  - can be used for both defense and offense

- **make sure you get authorization to do any kind of vulnerabilty assessment or
  penetration testing**
- **make sure you follow responsible disclosure when finding a vulnerability**

  - see below

- port scanning is a common assessment tool
- remote OS fingerprint is also a common assessment tool

- some of what `nmap` can do:

  - finding IP addresses of live hosts within a target network;
  - OS classification of each live host (OS fingerprinting, above);
  - identifying open ports on each live host (port scanning);
  - version detection (for open ports, identifying the service listening, and
    version)
  - network mapping (building a network topologyâ€”hosts and how they are
    connected)

- some of what `Nessus` can do:
  - remote vulnerability scanning
  - has a library of CVEs it checks for

## Vulnerability disclosure process

- [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Process](https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process)

- Read the
  [OWASP Vulnerability Disclosure Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html)

- USENIX Security 2025 ethics statement regarding vulnerability disclosure:

> Disclosures. Vulnerabilities, if known to adversaries, can expose people to
> negative outcomes, such as harms or rights violations. Publicly disclosing
> vulnerabilities before they have been privately disclosed to the responsible
> parties, and hence before they have been mitigated, can therefore expose
> people to negative outcomes. Adversaries or others can also independently
> discover vulnerabilities. The potential for independent adversary discovery
> means that knowing about vulnerabilities but not disclosing them to the
> responsible parties can also result in exposing people to negative outcomes.
> Additionally, in some cases it can take the responsible parties time to
> develop mitigations. Therefore, once a vulnerability has been discovered, it
> is important to initiate the mitigation process as early as possible.
> Specifically, absent strong and convincing reasons otherwise, we expect
> researchers to disclose vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered. If the
> researchers believe that a different timeline is the most ethical in their
> situation, they should present clear and convincing arguments for that
> different timeline. The arguments should clearly articulate why a delayed
> disclosure is in the best interest of users or people in general, e.g., most
> supportive of these people's wellbeing or least likely to violate their
> rights. Submissions that fail to disclose prior to submission and that do not
> present convincing ethical arguments for delaying disclosure may be rejected
> or may receive a revision decision.

> Often, the most direct path for vulnerability mitigation is to disclose the
> vulnerability to the responsible party, e.g. the manufacturer. In some cases,
> for example when the vulnerability is widespread or the mitigation process
> involves coordination with many organizations, the most ethical course of
> action may be to leverage organizations that coordinate vulnerability
> disclosure, such as the CISA in the United States, rather than or in addition
> to disclosing to affected parties directly.
