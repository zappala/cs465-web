# Networking background

![high level map of the Internet](/images/notes/worldBlack.jpg)

## Internet components and structure

The Internet is:

- roughly hierarchical
- composed of networks
- composed of routers, links, a wide variety of edge devices

![Internet components](/images/notes/fig01_01.png)

- networks connect using customer-provider relationships (usually in a
  contract!)
- tier-1 ISPs provide international coverage, treat each other as peers

![Internet components](/images/notes/fig01_11.png)

- [Lumen's network map](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/resources/network-maps.html)
  shows what a Tier 1 ISP looks like

- the Internet is only roughly hierarchical:

![Internet structure](/images/notes/internet-structure.png)

- _PoP (Point of Presence)_: router(s) in the provider's network where customer
  ISPs can connect
- _multi-homing_: customer ISPs may connect to more than one provider, for fault
  tolerance
- _peering_: connect directly to another ISP at the same level, instead of going
  through a provider, usually without any cost
- _IXP_: third-party location where ISPs can peer with each other
- _content provider networks_: large content providers (e.g. Google) have large
  networks, connect directly to lower-level ISPs and IXPs

## Principles

- Interoperability

  - each network is independent
  - they interoperate due to standards, especially: IP, BGP, TCP, DNS
  - a network can do whatever it wants internally

- packet switching

  - data is divided into packets
  - all packets from all sources share each link
  - each packet uses full link bandwidth
  - packets are stored before being forwarded
  - link never idle if some packets in the queue

### The triumph of packet switching

packet switching:

![packet switching](/images/notes/fig01_10.png)

- makes Internet routers very simple, with complexity at the edges
- see
  [End-to-end arguments in system design](https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/endtoend.pdf)
- enables the Internet to support a wide variety of applications
- for a long time, circuits were considered best for voice and video but we now
  use Skype and watch movies over the Internet

→ never underestimate the power of lots of bandwidth and caching

### Other Principles

- rough consensus and working code

  - implementations available
  - design influenced by experience: performance • fluid and open
    standardization body (IETF)

- open (rather than proprietary) architecture

## Internet architecture

![networking stack](/images/notes/fig01_19.png)

- layering helps to build complex systems

  - split large system into smaller pieces
  - identify each layer’s functionality and interfaces
  - can change a layer’s implementation as long as interfaces remain the same

- encapsulation vs decapsulation

### Why is the Internet so vulnerable to attacks?

[The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf)

- fundamental goal: develop an internetwork for existing networks
- second-level goals (in order of importance)
  - survivability
  - multiple types of service (delay vs bandwidth, reliable vs datagram)
  - variety of networks
  - distributed management
  - cost effective
  - host attachment with low effort
  - accountable resources

→ security was not considered
[Brief History of the Internet](https://www.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ISOC-History-of-the-Internet_1997.pdf)

## DNS: Domain Name System

- people like to use names for computers (www.byu.edu), but computers need to
  use numbers (128.187.16.184)
  - the Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database providing this
    service
  - a program sends a query a local resolver
  - the resolver contacts DNS servers as needed
- many DNS services
  - host name to IP address translation
  - host aliasing (canonical name versus alias names)
  - look up mail server for a host
  - load distribution - can provide a set of IP addresses for one canonical name
- demonstrate: _dig_

- domain name: top-level domain (TLD) + one or more subdomains
  - example: cs.byu.edu
  - may be 127 levels deep, 63 characters per label, 255 characters per name

![DNS hierarchy](/images/notes/fig02_19.png)
![DNS hierarchy](/images/notes/fig02_21.png)

- resolver contacts root name server if it doesn't have the mapping
- each server that doesn't know the mapping tells the local name server the
  identity of the next server in the hierarchy that can answer the query
- any name server that learns a mapping caches it
- TLD servers usually cached in a local name server, so root name server
  (theoretically) not visited often

## UDP

- best-effort service
  - connectionless: no state setup
  - unreliable: lost packets are not re-sent • no flow control
  - no congestion control (won't slow down, you can send as much and as fast as
    you want)

![UDP header](/images/notes/fig03_07.png)

- defined in [RFC 768, from 1980](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc768.txt)

  - port numbers (16 bits each)
  - length of UDP segment, including header (bytes)
  - checksum: detect some bit errors in transmitted segment
  - application data (sometimes called ADU)

- binary protocol

## TCP

![TCP segmentation](/images/notes/fig03_28.png)

- _pipelining_: multiple data segments outstanding at once
- VERY important to use the high bandwidth available on the Internet
- uses congestion control to slow down when the network is overloaded, converge
  to a roughly fair allocation of bandwidth among compeeting flows

![TCP sequence numbers](/images/notes/fig03_31.png)

- sequence number: byte number of this segment within the byte stream
- ACK number: sequence number of **next** byte expected from sender
  - an ACK tells the sender that the receiver has EVERYTHING up to but NOT
    INCLUDING the byte in the ack number
  - "this is the next in-order byte I am expecting"
- the power of cumulative ACKs
  - if an ACK is ever lost, a subsequent ACK synchronizes the state of the
    receiver with the sender
  - no need to retransmit lost ACKs, which would get messy

### TCP retransmission scenarios

### TCP handshake

![TCP handshake](/images/notes/fig03_39.png)

### TCP header

![TCP header](/images/notes/fig03_29.png)

- _sequence and ACK number_: count in terms of bytes
- flags
  - `A`: ACK number is valid
  - `R` (RST): reset connection
  - `S` (SYN): establish connection
  - `F` (FIN): close connection
  - `U` (URG): urgent data, typically not used
  - `P` (PSH): push (send) data immediately, used for TELNET
- _receive window_: number of bytes receiver can accept (flow control)

## IPv4

- common protocol for all networks
- very simple
- has lasted nearly years (since ~1978!)

![IPv4 header](/images/notes/fig04_13.png)

- source IP address (easily spoofed)
- destination IP address
- TTL (hop count)
- protocol: typically UDP or TCP

- IP addresses

  - 32 bits
  - dotted decimal notation
  - `byu.edu` is `128.187.16.184`

- forwarding process: check the destination address
  - _is this one of my addresses?_ send to next protocol specified in IP header
  - _is this one of my subnets?_ send to link layer to forward to the
    destination
  - _do I have a route?_ send to link layer to forward to next IP hop
  - _destination unknown!_ send an ICMP error to the source of the IP packet

## IPv6

![IPv6 header](/images/notes/fig04_24.png)

- simplified
- result of negotiation
- _traffic class_: enable routers to map traffic into classes (delay, loss
  guarantees, etc)
- _flow label_: uniquely identify all packets for a particular flow/application,
  used for QoS
- _Next Header_: upper layer protocol or option

- IPv6 addresses
  - 128 bits

## Link layer

![LAN](/images/notes/fig05_16.png)

- MAC addresses

  - used to get frame from one interface to another physically-connected
    interface (on the same network)
  - most are 48 bits long, depends on link-layer protocol
  - address burned into the adapter ROM
  - broadcast address usually all ones (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)

- address assignment administered by IEEE
  - manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (prefix)
  - uses that prefix for all MAC addresses and ensures it does not reuse the
    suffix
  - uniqueness provides address portability

### ARP: Address Resolution Protocol

- protocol that queries for IP addresses and maps to the associated MAC address
- each host builds a table

  - IP address
  - MAC address
  - TTL (e.g. 20 minutes)

- if host A has no entry for IP address B in table

  - A broadcasts ARP query for B
  - all hosts on LAN receive query
  - host with address B responds by unicast to A with its MAC address
  - all hosts hear query and response, cache translations for A and B in their
    ARP tables

- all hosts process all ARP packets, even if not addressed to themselves
