# Networking background

![high level map of the Internet](/images/notes/worldBlack.jpg)

## Internet components and structure

The Internet is:

- roughly hierarchical
- composed of networks
- composed of routers, links, a wide variety of edge devices

![Internet components](/images/notes/fig01_01.png)

- networks connect using customer-provider relationships (usually in a
  contract!)
- tier-1 ISPs provide international coverage, treat each other as peers

![Internet components](/images/notes/fig01_11.png)

- [Lumen's network map](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/resources/network-maps.html)
  shows what a Tier 1 ISP looks like

- the Internet is only roughly hierarchical, there may be many connections among
  peers and across levels

## Internet architecture

![networking stack](/images/notes/fig01_19.png)

- layering helps to build complex systems

  - split large system into smaller pieces
  - identify each layer's functionality and interfaces
  - can change a layer's implementation as long as interfaces remain the same

- encapsulation is used when sending packets, decapsulation is used when
  receiving packets

![encapsulation vs decapsulation](/images/notes/fig01_20.png)

## Link layer

![LAN](/images/notes/fig05_16.png)

- MAC addresses

  - used to get frame from one interface to another physically-connected
    interface (on the same network)
  - most are 48 bits long, depends on link-layer protocol
  - address burned into the adapter ROM
  - broadcast address usually all ones (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF)

- address assignment administered by IEEE
  - manufacturer buys portion of MAC address space (prefix)
  - uses that prefix for all MAC addresses and ensures it does not reuse the
    suffix
  - uniqueness provides address portability

## Network Layer

- IP -- Internet Protocol
- simplest definition of the Internet: _all the devices that speak IP_

### IPv4

- common protocol for all networks
- very simple
- has lasted nearly years (since ~1978!)

![IPv4 header](/images/notes/fig04_13.png)

- source IP address
- destination IP address
- TTL (hop count)
- protocol: typically UDP or TCP

- IP addresses

  - 32 bits
  - dotted decimal notation
  - `byu.edu` is `128.187.16.184`

- forwarding process: check the destination address
  - _is this one of my addresses?_ send to next protocol specified in IP header
  - _is this one of my subnets?_ send to link layer to forward to the
    destination
  - _do I have a route?_ send to link layer to forward to next IP hop
  - _destination unknown!_ send an ICMP error to the source of the IP packet

### IPv6

![IPv6 header](/images/notes/fig04_24.png)

- simplified
- result of negotiation
- _flow label_ and _traffic class_: used to map traffic into classes of service
- _Next Header_: upper layer protocol or option

- IPv6 addresses: 128 bits

### Routing Protocols

![routing problem](/images/notes/routing.png)

- routing protocols decide which route should a packet at A take to reach B
- different protocols for intra-network and inter-network routing -- see CS 460

## Transport Layer

### UDP

- best-effort service
  - connectionless: no state setup
  - unreliable: lost packets are not re-sent • no flow control
  - no congestion control (won't slow down, you can send as much and as fast as
    you want)

![UDP header](/images/notes/fig03_07.png)

- defined in [RFC 768, from 1980](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc768.txt)

  - port numbers (16 bits each)
  - length of UDP segment, including header (bytes)
  - checksum: detect some bit errors in transmitted segment
  - application data (sometimes called ADU)

- well-known ports: FTP (21), SSH (22), SMTP (25), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)

- binary protocol

### TCP

![TCP segmentation](/images/notes/fig03_28.png)

- _pipelining_: multiple data segments outstanding at once

  - VERY important to use the high bandwidth available on the Internet

- TCP has two primary functions

  - reliability
  - congestion control

- _reliability_

  - make sure every packet gets through
  - every packet gets a sequence number
  - resend any packets that are dropped

![tcp sequence number being acked by receiver](/images/notes/tcp-sequence-ack.png)

- _congestion control_

  - control the rate at which packets are sent

![the sender has a 1 GB of packets ready to send, how many bytes should it send?](/images/notes/tcp-congestion-control-question.png)

- basic algorithm

  - gradually increase rate
  - any dropped packet means you sent too fast -- slow down
  - then ramp back up again
  - continually probe for more bandwidth, but slow down when loss occurs
  - converges over time to a fair allocation of bandwidth among competing flows

![TCP header](/images/notes/fig03_29.png)

- _sequence and ACK number_: count in terms of bytes
- flags
  - `A`: ACK number is valid
  - `R` (RST): reset connection
  - `S` (SYN): establish connection
  - `F` (FIN): close connection
  - `U` (URG): urgent data, typically not used
  - `P` (PSH): push (send) data immediately, used for TELNET
- _receive window_: number of bytes receiver can accept (flow control)

## Why is the Internet so vulnerable to attacks?

[The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-clark.pdf)

- fundamental goal: develop an internetwork for existing networks
- second-level goals (in order of importance)
  - survivability
  - multiple types of service (delay vs bandwidth, reliable vs datagram)
  - variety of networks
  - distributed management
  - cost effective
  - host attachment with low effort
  - accountable resources
