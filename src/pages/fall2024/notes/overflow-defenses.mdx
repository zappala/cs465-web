# Overflow defenses

## Various defenses

- note, attackers may find ways around some of these -- see advanced reading

(1) make stack and heap non-executable

- default with `gcc` -- must turn off with `-z execstack`
- [Windows allows you to turn on Data Execution Prevention](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-data-execution-prevention-dep-60dabc2b-90db-45fc-9b18-512419135817)
- [details on how DEP works](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention)

(2) stack canary

- insert a randomly-chosen integer on the stack when a function is called
- check that the canary is intact before examining the return pointer
- can also use a heap canary
- default with `gcc` -- must turn off with `-fno stack-protector`

(3) address space layout randomization (ASLR)

- prevents the attacker from knowing where code is located
- position-independent execution (PIE) randomizes the code block

(4) memory layout randomization (ASLR)

- kernel protectino
- randomly positions the stack, heap, libraries
- makes it more difficult for an attacker to predict where code is loaded when a
  buffer is overflowed
- depends on the implementation being properly randomized -- see
  [The Illusion of Randomness: An Empirical Analysis of Address Space Layout Randomization Implementations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15107)

(5) position-independent execution (PIE)

- the binary is compiled so that each memory region has an offset from a fixed
  address, and the fixed address can change each time the binary is run
- PIE enables the text and data positions to be randomly positioned by ALSR

(6) type-safe languages

- [see NIST safer languages](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/safer-languages)
- [type safety in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html)

(7) other

- compiler bounds checking
- safe C libraries
- static analysis tools -- tools that analyze your code and warn you

### Adoption Barriers

- no governing body
- backwards compatibility
- incomplete solutions
