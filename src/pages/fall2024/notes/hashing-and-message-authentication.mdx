# Hashing and message authentication

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 2](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch2-rev1.pdf),
sections 2.5, 2.6

## Cryptographic hash functions

![cryptographic hash function](/images/notes/cryptographic-hash-function.png)

A cryptographic hash function takes an arbitrary length string as input and
produces a fixed length hash as an output. The output is also called a message
digest or fingerprint in some applications.

- desirable properties:

  - _one-way_ or _preimage resistance_: For any given value h, it is
    computationally infeasible to find x such that H(x) = h

    - there are actually many inputs that map to a single output (since the
      output is fixed size), but it is still comptuationally infeasible to find
      them

  - _second preimage resistance_: For any given block x, it is computationally
    infeasible to find y ≠ x with H(y) = H(x)
  - _collision resistance_ : it is computationally infeasible to find any pair
    (x, y) such that H(x) = H(y)

- Schneier (Secrets and Lies): _"They are probably the single most useful tool
  in a cryptographer's toolbox"_

![common cryptographic hash functions](/images/security-book/table-2.1.png)

- MD5 is deprecated

  - shown to not be collision resistant, so not suitable for digital signatures
    or TLS certificates

- SHA-1 is also deprecated -- discontinued by web browsers in 2017, by Microsoft
  for Windows Update in 2020

  - shown to not be collision resistant
  - chosen-prefix attack -- given two different prefixes, p1 and p2, attacker
    can find two suffixes, s1 and s2, such that H(p1 | s1) = hash(p2| s2) -- an
    attack in 2019 would cost $100,000

- SHA-2 and SHA-3 are considered secure

## Digital signatures

When we use digital signatures, we typically sign a hash instead of the original
message or file.

![digital signature used to sign a hash of a message](/images/security-book/figure-2.11.png)

- hash needs to be collision resistant

## Message authentication

A message authentication code covers both the integrity of the data and the
identity of the party that sent the message (since the other party is the only
one that shares a secret key).

![message authentication with a MAC](/images/security-book/figure-2.12.png)

- sender computes and sends a message authentication code (MAC), which the
  receiver verifies
- does not provide non-repudiation since either party could have created the
  message and MAC using the shared key

- HMAC builds a MAC from a hash function, e.g. HMAC-SHA256

  - H((K’ ⊕ opad) || H((K’ ⊕ ipad) || m))
    - H: a cryptographic hash function
    - m: the message to be authenticated
    - K’: H(K) if K is larger than the block size, otherwise K
    - opad: 0x5c5c5c...5c5c, one-block-long constant
    - ipad: 0x363636...3636, one-block-long constant
    - ⊕: XOR
    - ||: concatenation

- recommendation
  - if you need just a MAC, use HMAC
  - if you need encryption and a MAC, use AEAD, e.g. AES-GCM

## Class exercises

We are using the [Rust Crypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto) crates.

See the [Rust Cryptography](https://github.com/BYU-CS465/rust-cryptography) repo
for [SHA2](https://docs.rs/sha2/latest/sha2/) and
[SHA3](https://docs.rs/sha3/latest/sha3/) code examples.
