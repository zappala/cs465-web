# Learning Rust 3

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Learning Rust, Section 9

We are using [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

### Error handling

Rust does _not_ have exceptions. Instead, it has:

- `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors
- panic! for unrecoverable errors

### Panic

[Panic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html)
prints a failure message, unwinds (cleans up the stack), and quits. You can
display the call stack by setting an environment variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("crash and burn");
}
```

This will cause a panic:

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}
```

### Errors

Rust includes a
[Result enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html):

```
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

Here is an example of how to use it:

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() { let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}"),
    };

}
```

Note, instead of a panic, here, you could have an interface that asks the user
to choose a different file.

### Exercises

Complete the rustlings exercises for section 13, numbers 1-3. Numbers 4-6
contain advanced material.

## Learning Rust, Section 10

### Generic data types

Rust has
[generic data types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html), which
allow a function to operate on a type that is not known in advance.

For example, this function can find the largest value in vector of numbers or
characters:

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {result}");

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {result}");
}
```

You can also use generics when defining types, such as a `Point` that can handle
integer and floating point coordinates, and each coordinate can have a different
type:

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

Likewise, you can use generics in methods:

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

Here, the function `x()` is defined on `Point` and it returns a reference to
`x`, which is of type `T`.

### Traits

Rust uses [traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html) to
constrain types in a generic definition to ensure they implement some desired
functionality. For example, this `Summary` trait indicates that a type should
have a `summarize()` function:

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String;
}
```

Now we can define different types (as structs) that implement the `Summary`
trait:

```rust
pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(&self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

Assuming the above is in a library crate called `aggregator`, we can use it in
our main function:

```rust
use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}
```

### Binding traits

You can require a type implement a trait. For example, the `notify()` function
below requires an item that implements the `Summary` trait:

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

You can do this with a longer-form notation as well:

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

These are equivalent!

You can specify multiple traits this way:

```rust
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
```

or with a `where` clause:

```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
where
    T: Display + Clone,
    U: Clone + Debug,
{
```

### Exercises

You are now ready to do rustlings section 14 on generics and 15 on traits.
