# Stack Overflows

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html]),
[Chapter 6](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf),
sections 6.3

## Stack-based buffer overflow attacks

- Stack overflow attacks are REALLY common -- see
  [CVE list](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/opov-1/overflow.html)

- Understand memory layout of a process: Figure 6.3, page 166

![Common memory layout](/images/security-book/figure-6.3.png)

- Data = initialized global variables
- BSS = block starting symbol, where unitialized global memory is stored, eg. in
  C: `static int bufferX[4];`)
- Heap = dynamically allocated memory, e.g. in C using `malloc()`
- Stack = memory needed by the current function, e.g. parameters, local
  variables, return address

- Understand how a process uses the stack: Figure 6.4, page 167

- In a stack overflow, the attacker tries to write code to the stack and get the
  OS to execute it

- Understand the basics of a buffer overflow attack: Example, _Buffer Overflow_,
  page 167, Figure 6.5, page 168

- Note, this example assumes 4-byte memory words, but it works regardless of
  word size

```c
void myfunction(char *src) { /* src is a ptr to a char string */
  int var1, var2; /* 1 stack word used per integer */
  char var3[4]; /* also 1 word for 4-byte buffer */
  strcpy(var3, src); /* template: strcpy(dst, src) */
}
```

## Class exercises

See the [software security repo](https://github.com/BYU-CS465/software-security)
for code we will use:

- In `buffer-overflow` we will run `stack`, which has an buffer overflow
  problem. We'll use the `exploit.py` script to help create the overflow and
  direct the program to a return address of our choosing. This code implements
  the toy example from the book.

Time permitting, we will also try the `buffer overflow 0` and `buffer overflow `
exploits on the
[PicoCTF website](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/257?category=6&page=1&search=buffer).
