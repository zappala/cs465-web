# Phishing

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 9](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf),
sections 9.8.

## Types of Phishing Attacks

- _phishing_: tricks a person into visiting a fraudulent version of a legitimate
  website, with the goal of obtaining sensitive information -- passwords,
  banking information, credit card details

- _spear phishing_: targeted to a particular individual or organization

  - can be more convincing since it is targeting an individual
  - attacker will research the target in advance
  - can purport to come from a known contact or include reference to known
    information

- _whaling_: targeted to higher-level management

- [see Crowdstrike explanation and examples](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/phishing/spear-phishing/)

## Phishing enablers

- _mental model_: a person's understanding of how a system works and what it
  does

  - influences a person's security-related decisions / threat model
  - phishing may exploit flaws in a person's mental model
  - software developers (especially working in security) should try to align
    their software with mental models

- URLs by design hide the actual link
- typosquatting
- redirects
- web design that looks like the authentic website or "looks trustworthy"
- copycate domains, like `paypal-security.com` or `pay.pal.com`
- misunderstanding that the lock icon means a site is "safe"

## Phishing defenses

- spam filtering
- domain filtering
- user education

- notes of interest
  - transient phishing sites are a problem
  - once users are on a fraudulent site, even experts have a hard time detecting
    this

## Security indicators

- a closed padlock icon or warnings (Not Secure)

  - visit [badssl.com http site](http://http.badssl.com/) to see what different
    browsers do with plain HTTP websites these days

- this aspect alone has been studied for decades

  - see for example
    [Rethinking Connection Security Indicators](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2016/soups2016-paper-porter-felt.pdf)
    if you want to see older justification for Chrome's designs

- read
  [Google's justification for removing the lock icon](https://blog.chromium.org/2023/05/an-update-on-lock-icon.html)

_Replacing the lock icon with a neutral indicator prevents the misunderstanding
that the lock icon is associated with the trustworthiness of a page, and
emphasizes that security should be the default state in Chrome. Our research has
also shown that many users never understood that clicking the lock icon showed
important information and controls. We think the new icon helps make permission
controls and additional security information more accessible, while avoiding the
misunderstandings that plague the lock icon._

- lock icon dates from 1990s
- meant to indicate HTTPS (secure connection)
- in a study of 1880 participants,
  [only 11% of participants correctly understood the meaning of the lock icon](https://research.google/pubs/it-builds-trust-with-the-customers-exploring-user-perceptions-of-the-padlock-icon-in-browser-ui/)
- lots of [previous research](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4223213)
  showing similar misunderstandings
- nearly all phishing sites use HTTPS, so the lock doesn't indicate
  trustworthiness
- new icon
  - does not imply "trustworthy"
  - is more obviously clickable
  - is commonly associated with settings

## Usable security

- area of research that combines human factors and security

  - merges two areas of CS (HCI, security)
  - frequently uses theories and methods from psychology and sociology

- a small selection of lessons learned from usable security research:
