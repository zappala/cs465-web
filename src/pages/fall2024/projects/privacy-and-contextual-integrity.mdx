# Privacy and contextual integrity

## Objectives

In addition to thinking carefully about security threats, businesses and
consumers need to understand privacy issues that affect them and their data. In
this project, you will find and examine privacy incidents in the news using the
contextual integrity framework.

## Requirements

**In this project, you should work with up to two partners (groups of 2 or 3
people).** If you really want to, you are permitted to work alone.

### Tech industry news articles

Find 3 news articles from the tech industry that describe privacy incidents. You
will want to be sure that the article contains enough technical detail for you
to complete the assignment. You are welcome to share interesting articles with
each other in Discord, to help us collect some good ones. Ultimately, you are
responsible for finding articles with enough detail to complete the assignment.

### Analysis

For each article, write a page (maximum) that includes. the following
information. You should use a professional, scientific writing style. This means
that you need complete sentences. Paragraphs should start with a topic setence.
Your audience is a beginning level CS student.

- Overview: a paragraph that describes the privacy incident, with some technical
  detail.
- Context: a paragraph that identifies the five parameters in the contextual
  integrity framework and how they apply to this incident. These are (a) data
  subject, (b) sender, (c) recipient, (d) information type, and (e) transmission
  principle. Refer to the readings for an explanation of these. You are
  encouraged to use bullets for each of these, but be sure to start with an
  introductory sentence or two. Remember, your audience may not have heard of
  contextual integrity, so you need to explain it.
- Analysis: a paragraph that explains how contextual integrity clarifies the
  privacy issues in this incident.

## Rubric

- 30 points for each news article, awarded as:
  - 10 points for each section/paragraph, with 10
  - 10 points = A, clear, scientific writing and contextual integrity clearly
    explained and used
  - 9 points = A-, sound use of contextual integrity but needs writing
    improvements
  - 8 points = B, some good work, not a thorough job of using contextual
    integrity
  - 7 points = C, a good start but needs substantial improvements
  - 0 points = E, no effort or clearly substandard

## Submission

List the full name of all group members in your report. Have one group member
