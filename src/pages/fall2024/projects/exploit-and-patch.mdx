# Project: Explioit and Patch

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain experience recognizing TOCTOU race conditions,
integer-based vulnerabilities, and buffer overflows. You will also get your
first taste of exploiting vulnerabilities. Finally, you will practice writing
patches for the vulnerabilities you identify.

## Requirements

In this project you will be looking for vulnerabilities in seven simple
programs, exploiting those vulnerabilities, and writing patches to fix those
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will cover the types of vulnerabilities
discussed in class:

- TOCTOU race conditions
- Integer-based vulnerabilities
- Buffer overflows

To start, download and unzip the
[handout](/code/fall2024/exploit-and-patch-handout.tar.gz). This directory has
seven binaries you will need to exploit, labeled `problem{1-7}`. For this
project, I have turned off various protections to allow exploits to work. For
example, the binaries will not use a stack canary or ASLR.

Along with the binaries, I have also provided a `problem#.c` file. This is the
file is very similar to the file from which the binary was compiled. However,
this file has had any secret information removed.

If you wish to compile the code files, use `make binaries`. This will build
binaries in the `./out/` directory to avoid erasing the binaries in the
workspace directory. Do not compile any other way as this may result in deleting
the binaries in the workspace directory, which are necessary to complete the
project.

### Open a Dev Container

Use `View -> Command Pallette` or type `F1` to open the command pallette. Run
the following command: `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container`. You need to
run this assignment in a container since we are exploiting vulnerabilities and
have turned off various protections. Alternatively, if you already have the
folder for your code open, you can use `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

### Identifying Vulnerabilities

Each program has a single vulnerability you will need to identify. This
vulnerability will result in the execution of the `void flag()` function, which
would otherwise not be called. You should identify this vulnerability by looking
at the source code for the program. You do not need to and **should not**
examine the binary itself. This will waste your time and cause the project to
take much longer than intended.

### Exploiting the Vulnerability

Next, you will need to determine what input you need to provide to the program
to exploit the program's vulnerability. On a successful exploit, the flag will
be printed out by the program. Flags are in the format `flag{366-fL4G-H3r3}`.

Remember, you can pipe input to the program from a file using
`./program << program.input`. This can be helpful as you are fine tuning your
exploit so you don't have to hand enter strings. You can use the `exploit.py`
program to help generate an exploit string.

### Patching the vulnerability

Finally, you will write a patch to correct the vulnerability. You will do so by
editing the `problem#.c` file for each problem. In most cases, these patches
will be very simple and will involve modifying one or two lines. Make sure that
your patch doesn't create new vulnerabilities. **Note, a valid patch fixes the
vulnerability and nothing else.** It does not just remove the call to
`void flag()` or removes any intended functionality.

To compile and check that your code is correct, you can use `make all`. To
generate a diff file for your patch (how patches are applied) use the
`make diff` command. You can then find your diffs in `./diff/`.

## Notes and Hints

### Problem 3

You are not going to be able to steal the value of secret. How else might you
cause the password check to pass?

### Problem 5

For this problem, you will need to write a bash script to execute and exploit
the binary. This script should run the problem binary, conduct the steps
necessary to exploit it, and allow the flag to be printed out. In particular,
you may this helpful:

```
PID=$!
```

This will get the process ID of the process most recently put into the
background. You may also find `sleep`, `kill`, and `touch` helpful.

- Make sure to include your script in the writeup.
- When patching this binary, the functionality you are trying to achieve is to
  ensure that the file doesn't exist before you open it. If you do so, we will
  count this as preserving necessary functionality.

### Problem 6

- If you create a script, make sure to include it in your writeup.

### Problem 7

Do not fix by removing the threading or modifying how subtraction is done one
value at a time.

## Writeup

I have provided a `submission.md` file that you will use to writeup your
results. This is the file you will submit and be graded on.

For each problem, this file has a place for you to list the following
information:

1. The flag
2. The steps necessary to exploit the binary. _(May be a single line.)_
3. A patch that fixes the exploit. _(Generated using `make diff`.)_
4. An explanation of what the vulnerability was and how the patch fixes it.
   _(Keep this explanation short and to the point.)_

The `README.md` file in the handout gives an example of how the report should
look.

## Grading Rubric

For each problem, you can receive 40 points:

- 10 points for correctly extracting the flag from the binary
- 10 points for listing the steps needed to execute your exploit
- 10 points for providing a correct patch
- 10 points for explaining what the vulnerability is and how you patched it

As there are seven problems, this means that there are a total of 280 points for
this project.
