# Project: Encrypted Communication

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain experience using cryptographic primitives to
implement encrypted communication between a client and a server.

We are providing you with a server and your job will be to write a client to
communicate with it.

## Project Setup

Download
[the handout](/code/encrypted-communication/v1/encrypted-communication.tgz) for
this assignment and put it in a folder. The handout includes a Dev Container, so
When you open this folder in Visual Studio Code, it should ask you to reopen it
in a container.

Using a Linux container will enable you to run the binary for the server, which
has been compiled for Linux.

## Client-Server Protocol

The client and server communicate using the following protocol:

![encryption project](/images/projects/encrypted-communication/v1/encrypted-communication-v1-protocol.png)

- The client sends the server a Hello Message containing a nonce
- The server responds with a Hello Message that includes its RSA public key (in
  PEM format), the nonce, and a signed version of the nonce
- The client verifies the signature and, if it is valid, accepts the server's
  public key
- For every message the client sends to the server it:
  - Creates a new symmetric key K and a nonce
  - Encrypts the key K with the server's public key
  - Encrypts the message with K
  - Sends the server an Encrypted Message message that includes the encrypted
    key, the nonce, and the encrypted message
- The server responds to an Encrypted Message with a Server Response that
  includes:
  - a new nonce
  - the message, encrypted with the same key but the new nonce
- The client decrypts and prints each Encrypted Message the server sends it

## Implementing the Client

You should write your code in the provided `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;

mod messages;
use messages::{EncryptedMessage, HelloMessage, ServerResponse};

fn main() {
    let mut stream = match TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:2222") {
        Ok(stream) => stream,
        Err(_e) => {
            println!("Could not connect to server. Check that it is running");
            return ();
        }
    };
    println!("Connected to server");
}
```

This code connects to the server and then exits. You should add code so that the
client:

- sends a Hello Message
- parses the server response
- loops
  - reads some text from the terminal
  - if the text is "exit", break from the loop
  - otherwise, send an Encrypted Message
  - parse the Server Response

A sample session should look like this:

```bash
./binaries/server
# note, quit the server with control-c
```

```bash
cargo run client
Connected to server
Hello exchanged
Enter message: this is a test message
Received: this is a test message
Enter message: lovely to see this working
Received: lovely to see this working
Enter message: exit
```

Note, you will need to open two terminals for this project. If the server
doesn't have the proper execution permissions, you can add them:

```bash
chmod u+x ./binaries/server
```

### Messages

We have provided a `src/messages.rs` module that provides `structs` for the
different message types as well as methods that convert these structs to/from
JSON. You should be able to use this module without making any changes to it.

For example, here is a Hello Message:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct HelloMessage {
    pub signed_message: Vec<u8>,
    pub pub_key: String,
    pub nonce: [u8; 32],
}

impl HelloMessage {
    pub fn to_json(&self) -> Result<String, serde_json::Error> {
        serde_json::to_string(self)
    }

    pub fn from_json(message: String) -> Result<HelloMessage, serde_json::Error> {
        serde_json::from_str(&message)
    }
}
```

You can create an initial Hello Message with:

```rust
// assume you have created the nonce
let hello = HelloMessage {
    signed_message: vec![],
    pub_key: "".to_string(),
    nonce,
};
```

and convert it to json:

```rust
let json = hello.to_json()?;
```

Likewise when you receive a message as bytes, you can convert it into a JSON
string and then convert that JSON string into a message, e.g. using
`HelloMessage::from_json()`.

### TCP Stream

The client and server use a TCP socket to send messages. Using the `stream`
TCPStream object in the provided code, you can use the following methods.

To write to the TCP stream:

```rust
// json should be the result of one of the to_json() methods above
stream.write_all(json.as_bytes());
```

To read from the TCP stream:

```rust
// we assume that all messages are shorter than 4096 bytes and
// will be read in one call to read()
let mut buffer = [0; 4096];
let bytes_read = stream.read(&mut buffer)?;
// an example of how to convert the buffer to a JSON string
// you can do something similar for other message types
let server_hello_json = str::from_utf8(&buffer[..bytes_read]).expect("Server hello not in UTF8");
```

See the following for additional documentation:

- [TCPStream](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html)
- [write_all()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html#method.write_all)
- [read()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html#tymethod.read)

### Rust Crypto

For the Rust crypto, use:

- [Rsa](https://docs.rs/rsa/latest/rsa/) -- the client will need to convert the
  public key from the PEM format it receives, derive the verifying key from the
  public key, verify the `PKCS#1 v1.5` signature on the nonce, and encrypt the
  symmetric key with `Pkcs1v15Encrypt` padding
- [PKCS #1 v1.5 Signature](https://docs.rs/rsa/latest/rsa/pkcs1v15/struct.Signature.html) -
  the client will need to convert a signature in bytes to a Signature struct,
  see the `try_from()` method
- [AES GCM](https://docs.rs/aes-gcm/latest/aes_gcm/) -- the client will need to
  generate a symmetric key, generate a nonce, and encrypt plaintext

You can see the
[Rust Cryptography](https://github.com/BYU-CS465/rust-cryptography) examples we
covered in class as examples of how to use these libraries.

### Rust Tips

(1) This code uses a nonce that is 32 bytes long. You can generate this with:

```rust
let mut nonce = [0u8; 32];
thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut nonce);
```

(2) To create a verifying key, you can use:

```rust
VerifyingKey::<Sha256>::from_public_key_pem()
```

(3) To import a nonce from the server, you can use:

```rust
let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(&nonce_vec[..]);
```

## Grading Rubric

- Total (50 points)
  - 10 points for sending the server a valid Hello Message
  - 10 points for sending the server a valid Encrypted Message
  - 10 points for sending the server a symmetric encryption key that is
    encrypted with its public key.
  - 10 points for sending the server a message that is correctly encrypted with
    the symmetric key and nonce
  - 10 points for using a new encryption key and nonce with every Encrypted
    Message
