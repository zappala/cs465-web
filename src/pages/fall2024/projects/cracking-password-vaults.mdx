# Project: Cracking Password Vaults

## Objectives

You have managed to breach the storage of a password manager company and
obtained encrypted vaults and password hashes for each of their users. You have
some particular vaults that you are interested in decrypting because they
contain the username and password for some accounts for "interesting"
individuals. You believe these individuals may have a weak password that may
appear in a separate list of breached passwords you have acquired.

## Project Setup

Download
[the handout](/code/cracking-password-vaults/v1/cracking-password-vaults.tgz)
for this assignment. This contains:

- a folder called `practice`, which contains a practice vault and the password
  for this vault
- a folder called `breach`, which contains:
  - a set of vaults that you have obtained from a password manager company
  - a set of passwords that you have separately obtained from a password breach
    dataset

## Password Vaults

The password vaults have been encrypted with the following process:

![cracking password vaults](/images/projects/cracking-password-vaults/v1/vault-encryption-process.png)

- the password and a random salt are used to derive a hash and a key with
  PBKDF2, a password-based key derivation function
  - the system uses 100,100 iterations of PBKDF2 to derive a hash
  - the system uses 100,1001 iterations of PBKDF2 to derive a key
- the key and a random nonce are used to encrypt the vault using AES GCM

The salt, hash, nonce, and vault are coded into hex values.

The password manager company then stores password vaults and their associated
information in this format:

`username:hex_salt:hex_hash:hex_nonce:hex_vault`

## Practice Vault

As a first step, write code to decrypt the practice vault. You have the password
for this vault, so you can work through the steps to decrypt a vault:

- convert the salt, nonce, and vault from hex to byte arrays using the
  [base16ct](https://docs.rs/base16ct/latest/base16ct/) crate

  - the salt is 12 bytes of `u8`
  - the nonce is 12 bytes of `u8`
  - the vault is variable size, so convert it to a vector of `u8`

- use the salt and the password with
  [pbkdf2](https://docs.rs/pbkdf2/latest/pbkdf2/) to generate the key and the
  hash

- convert the hash to hex and compare it to the hash from the vault to be sure
  they match

- use the key and the nonce with AES GCM to decrypt the vault

- print the username and the vault contents

## Breach Vaults

For each of of the vaults, try each of the breach passwords to see if one of
them works to decrypt the vault. Note: - if the hash doesn't match, this is not
the right password - if the hash does match, the vault should be able to be
decrypted with the nonce and key, so you don't need to try any more passwords.
It is possible none of the passwords match for any given vault.

You should be able to crack 3 of the 6 vaults.

## Grading Rubric

- Total (40 points)
  - 10 points for each vault you can crack

## Submission

- Submit the output of your cracking program, which should show us the contents
  of all of the cracked vaults. It is OK if you also show every password as you
  check it for each vault.
- Submit your code.

Use the `tar` command and your BYU netID to compress your files:

```bash
tar --exclude=target --exclude=.git -czvf byuNetID.tar directory
```

Submit your tar file on Learning Suite.
