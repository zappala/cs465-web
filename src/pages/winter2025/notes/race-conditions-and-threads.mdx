# Race Conditions and Threads

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 6](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf),
sections 6.0 - 6.1.

## Key Concepts

- understand why software security is important -- your most likely
  security-related role if you will be a developer
- the importance of thinking like an attacker if you are a defender
- we study C because it is filled with security vulnerabilities, these are still
  prevalent, and we see them plague other languages as well

### Race Conditions

- time-of-check, time-of-use (TOCTOU) race

  - see
    [Figure 6.1, page 157](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch6-rev1.pdf)
  - see the subsequent example
  - walk through example in Figure 6.2

- the book walks through various approaches and discusses pros and cons -- this
  is useful to understanding offensive and defensive thinking

### Threads

- Creating a thread: see
  [pthread_create() man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_create.3.html).

```c
// initialize a thread
pthread_t thread;
// create a thread
//  1. pointer to a thread
//  2. thread attributes (can define stack size, scheduling priority, etc)
//  3. pointer to a function that the thread will run,
//     takes a void pointer as its only argument and returns a void pointer
//  4. pointer to the argument for the above function
pthread_create(&thread, NULL, &doit, &p);
```

- Waiting for a child thread to finish: see
  [pthread_join() man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_join.3.html)

```c
// wait for a child thread to finish
//   1. pointer to a thread
//   2. pointer for the return value
pthread_join(&thread, NULL);
```

- Printing a thread identifier: see
  [pthread_self() man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_self.3.html)

```c
cout << pthread_self()
```

- See the `threads-example` program in the class exercises

### Mutexes

- Provides a way for a thread to lock access to shared memory
- A thread locks and then unlocks a mutex
  - The area between the lock/unlock is called a critical section
- See the
  [pthread_mutex_init() man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_mutex_init.3p.html),
  [this Stack Overflow description of mutex attributes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4252005/what-is-the-attribute-of-a-pthread-mutex),
  and the
  [pthread_mutex_lock() man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_mutex_lock.3p.html).

```c
// declare the mutex
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
// initialize the mutex
//   1. a pointer to a mutex
//   2. attributes for the mutex
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL);
// lock the mutex
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
// unlock the mutex
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex)
```

## Class Exercises

See the [software security repo](https://github.com/BYU-CS465/software-security)
for code we will use:

- In `race` we will see an example of threads using `thread-example`
- In `race` we will run an `inventory` program with a vulnerability, then fix it
  with mutexes in `inventory-fixed`. We will then show a monitor-like solution
  to provide better scalability and reliability in `inventory-monitor`.
- For both of these we will explain the Docker and Makefile setup that
  accompanies this code.
