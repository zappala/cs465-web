# Access Control

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/),
an open source textbook. You shoud have read these sections:

- [Introduction to Operating System Security](hhttps://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/security-intro.pdf)
- [Access Control](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/security-access.pdf)

## Key concepts

### OS Security

- Everything runs on top of the OS, so if it is insecure ... ðŸ˜±
- The more complex a prgram, the harder it is to secure. The OS is really
  complex. So is the browser, which acts almost like a layer above the OS these
  days.
- Recall, the OS can:

  - examine or alter any processâ€™s memory
  - read, write, delete or corrupt any file on any writeable persistent
  - storage medium, including hard disks and flash drives
  - change the scheduling or even halt execution of any process
  - send any message to anywhere, including altered versions of those a process
    wished to send
  - enable or disable any peripheral device
  - give any process access to any other processâ€™s resources
  - arbitrarily take away any resource a process controls
  - respond to any system call with a maximally harmful lie

- We assume the OS is secure, but a flaw in a program can allow an attacker to
  hijack the OS

- Security goals (often abbreviated CIA):
  - confidentiality
  - integrity
  - availability
- Sometimes we want _non-repudiation_ -- an entity that communicates something
  can't later deny that it did

- Important design principles from
  [The Protection of Information in Computer Systems](https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/):

  - economy of mechanism: as small and simple as possible
  - fail-safe defaults: default to security
  - complete mediation: any time an action is going to be taken, check security
    policies
  - open design: assume an attacker knows everything about how the system is
    built
  - separation of privilege: require separate parties or credentials (e.g. 2FA)
  - least privilege: give a user or process the lowest privileges possible for
    them to do their job
  - least common mechanism: use separate data structures for separate processes
    or functionality
  - acceptability: ease of use -- users must want to use it

### Access control

- Basic idea
- Figure out if the request fits within the security policy.
- If it does, perform the operation. If not, make sure it isn't done
- For example

- If a process wants to open a file for reading and writing, should the OS let
  it? How does it know?

- A reference monitor is the part of the OS that enforces policy when a
  `subject` requests `access` to an `object`
- Two common methods: `access control lists`, `capabilities`
- Access control list

  - for each object, list which subjects have a type of access
  - e.g. for a file, list which users have read access
  - ror UNIX/Linux, early designers chose to use 9 bits for each file
    - execute (x), write (w), read (r)
    - user/owner (u), group (g), other/world (o)
  - saves lots of space! stored in file metadata in the file system
  - hard to find ALL of the resources a given user has access to

- Capabilities

  - for each subject, list which objects they have access to
  - e.g. for a user, list which files they have read access to
  - think of a capability as a set of physical keys, giving a process access to
    certain rooms in a house
  - e.g., a process may be given the capability to read/write files in a given
    directory
  - capabilities must be controlled by the OS (or else any process could give
    itself any capability)
  - behind the scenes, an OS like Linux will use capabilities to keep track of
    access once it is granted

- _Mandatory access control_: an organization/government/enterprise controls
  access for all objects
- _Discretionary access control_: the owner of an object controls access
- _Role-based access control_: access based on your role (e.g. a customer can
  order products, an inventory manager can change inventory status, an admin can
  change roles)
- _Privilege escalation_: temporarily gain access beyond normal level, e.g.
  `sudo`, `setuid` bit

## Class Exercises

Run a `linux-land` Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 2222:22 --name lotr zappala/linux-land
```

Login as `bilbo`. Try:

```bash
ls /root
```

What happens and why?

Login as `root`. Run this:

```bash
# see current permissions on the ls program
ls -al /bin/ls
# set the suid bit on ls
chmod u+s /bin/ls
# see current permissions on the ls program
ls -al /bin/ls
# store a secret in a file
cat > secret.txt
This password will get you into my account: tolkien
# type control-d when done
control-d
# exit
exit
```

Login as `bilbo`. Can you see the file? Can you gain access to the secret? If
not, how would you do it?
