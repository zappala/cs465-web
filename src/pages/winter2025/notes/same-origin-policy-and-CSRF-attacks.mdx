# Same origin policy and CSRF attacks

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 9](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch9-rev1.pdf),
sections 9.4, 9.5.

## Same origin policy

Goals:

1. Prevent JavaScript from one site interfering with a web page from another
   site

- without this, a malicious site could load JavaScript to read your credit card
  details on another site that you have loaded

2. Allow friendly domains to share scripts

- e.g. two divisions of the same company, ads from third parties

--

- background info
  - origin = (scheme, host, port)
  - sharing scripts is possible with

```javascript
<script src="https://domain2/script.js" />
```

Same origin policy

- lets a site load scripts, images, documents, etc from a different origin
- but prevents the site from _reading_ the script, image, document, etc that is
  loaded
- origin must match scheme, host, port

Rules

- cookies: browser can only access cookies for the same origin as the current
  page, but port is excluded from matching rules
- LocalStorage/SessionStorage: browser can only access storage for the same
  origin
- DOM: A script from origin A can't access the DOM of a page from origin B
- fetch requests: A script from origin A can't fetch data from origin B unless
  explicitly allowed by the server for origin B

[a good, brief explanation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cors/same-origin-policy)
from PortSwigger

- [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) -- Cross-origin
  Resource Sharing allows a _server_ to set policy for which origins may request
  its content via a fetch
- the book discusses relaxing the same-origin policy by manipulating
  `document.domain`.
  [This is now disallowed by browsers.](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain)

## Authentication cookies

- used to identify a session _after_ login

  - `Set-Cookie: sessionID=abcd12345`
  - should be sufficiently random and thus not easy to guess
  - should have an expiration time

- cookie theft

  - need to avoid sending cookies to malicious sites
    - `HttpOnly` -- only accessible over HTTP(S) and not via DOM through
      JavaScript on the page
  - need to avoid malicious HTTP proxies
    - `Secure` -- cookie will only be sent over HTTPS
  - other vulnerabilities
    - non-script client-side malware (e.g. keylogger, malicious browser
      extension)
    - access to cookie storage on client side

- sensitive data in cookies should be encrypted and protected with a MAC (e.g.
  authenticated encryption) or encrypted and signed

## CSRF: Cross-Site Request Forgery

- goal of the attacker is to control what is sent in a request that is
  authorized by an authentication cookie
  - all the attacker needs to do is include the `Cookie` header with an
    appropriate sessionID in its request

### Example

- A bank allows funds to be transferred via a `POST` request:

```http
POST http://mybank.com/fundxfer.php HTTP/1.1
... to=Bob&value=2500
```

- or with a `GET` request:

```http
GET http://mybank.com/fundxfer.php?to=Bob&value=2500 HTTP/1.1
```

- An attacker just needs Alice to visit their site, which contains:

```html
<a href="http://mybank.com/fundxfer.php?to=Charlie&value=2500">
  Click here...shocking news!!!</a
>
```

- Alternatively, the attacker can send Alice an email with this 0x0 "hidden"
  image:

```html
<img
  width="0"
  height="0"
  border="0"
  src="http://mybank.com/fundxfer.php?to=Charlie&value=2500"
/>
```

- Yet another attack, have Alice visit a page that has a hidden form, plus a
  browser event handler (`onload`) that causes the form to be submitted with the
  apprpriate POST request to Alice's bank

> In all cases, since Alice's browser is sending the request to the bank, it
> includes Alice's session ID for the bank in a `Cookie` header, assuming Alice
> is still logged in with her bank.

- Attacks can be more subtle -- e.g. a POST request that changes Alice's email
  address, which can then be used for account recovery at Alice's bank.

- CSRF is a form of a _confused deputy_ problem -- an entity that doesn't have
  permission to perform an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform
  the action

- notes

  - can't rely on checking IP addresses, since the request comes from the victim
  - requires a current session -- hence financial sites regularly log you out

- CRSF mitigation: CSRF tokens

  - generate a unique, secret, random token
  - give token to user in response header for a GET request for the page where a
    form is located
  - when the user submits the form, the POST request includes the token in a
    request header
  - server must maintain state for the token and check that it matches
  - this prevents the CSRF attack because the malicious POST request won't have
    a valid token

- CSRF mitigation: Double-Submit cookie pattern

  - generate a signed CSRF token and store it in a cookie
  - also put the CSRF token in a hidden form field on the requested page
  - when the user submits the form and sends a POST request, it includes the
    cookie in the HTTP header and in the submitted form (in the POST body) --
    these must match and be signed by the server
  - server does not need to store any state
  - attacker request will have a cookie but not the hidden form field
