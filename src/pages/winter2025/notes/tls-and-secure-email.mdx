## Ungraded Quiz

- What is the difference between a DV and an EV certificate?
- What are some basic differences between PGP and S/MIME?

## Key Concepts

### TLS

- _TLS_ = Transport Layer security
  - Predecesser called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
  - add security to any TCP connection
- TLS certificates associate public keys with domains
- DV (Domain Validated) certificates
  - demonstrate control of the domain, which could be responding to email sent to `admin@domain.com`
  - inexpensive or free
- OV (Organization Validated) certificates
  - manual checks to certify ownership of a real-world organization
- EV (Extended Validation) certificates verify
  - real-world existance of a legal entity in the `Subject`
  - registration in government-recognized databases
  - physical existence matching location in certificate
  - identity of person requesting certificate and their relationship to the organization
  - control of the domain
- IV (Individual validated) certificates
  - user decided to trust them (e.g. self-signed certificates)
- users don't know the difference between DV, OV, and EV

  - the author was on a team that [proposed design changes that could show the different levels of validation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1655008.1655012), but there were no significant differences in user actions between DV and EV certificates
  - [An Evaluation of Extended Validation and Picture-in-Picture Phishing Attacks](https://www.adambarth.com/papers/2007/jackson-simon-tan-barth.pdf) -- study showing Internet Explorer EV certificate interface didn't help users identify phishing attacks
  - can't prove a CA takes these validation steps anyway

  - [Rethinking Connection Security Indicators](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2016/soups2016-paper-porter-felt.pdf) -- if you want to see justification for Chrome's designs

- explore browser interfaces for certificates
- any CA can create a certificate for any website
- attacks on certificates
  - rogue certificates -- see [Hackers spied on 300,000 Iranians using fake Google certificate](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2510951/hackers-spied-on-300-000-iranians-using-fake-google-certificate.html), 2011
  - TLS stripping attacks -- block the signal to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS
    - see website configuration below
    - use browser tools to see the redirect
    - see HTTPS Everywhere browser extension
  - revocation failures can be exploited
- difficulties with browser trust model
  - poor trust agility -- users are given root certs and it is up to the browser or OS vendor to decide who is trusted
  - intermediate CAs are unaccountable -- can only remove root CAs
- certificate transparency helps expose rogue certificates
  - for details, see [Certificate Transparency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2659897)
- a bug in TLS affects massive amounts of ecommerce
  - see [Heartbleed 101](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876249) and the included xkcd comic
- the widespread use of CDNs for content delivery means CDNs have wbesite private keys
  - see [Content Delivery Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/configure/configure-cdn) for a good picture of a CDN
  - see [Measurement and Analysis of
    Private Key Sharing in the HTTPS Ecosystem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2976749.2978301)
  - see [When HTTPS Meets CDN: A Case of Authentication in Delegated Service](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6956557)

#### Common website configuration

```
server {
  if ($host = cs465.byu.edu) {
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
  }
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  server_name cs465.byu.edu;
  return 404; # managed by Certbot
}
```

### Let's Encrypt

- It used to be expensive to get a certificate for a website
  - You can now get one free with Let's Encrypt
  - It uses a protocol called ACME to automatically verify you own a domain
  - For example, you contact an ACME server to request a certificate, and it
    gives you a file to serve from your website, once it verifies that you are
    serving it, then it issues you the certificate
  - see [Let's Encrypt Stats](https://letsencrypt.org/stats/)

Extra reading:

- [Letâ€™s Encrypt: An Automated Certificate Authority to Encrypt the Entire Web](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3319535.3363192)
  -- describes how Let's Encrypt was built,the ACME protocol, lessons learned

### Secure email

- goal is to have end-to-end encryption of messages between communicating parties
  - intermediate servers can't read the message
  - really straightforward security but email is VERY old and was built with no security
  - any encryption of email content means a server processing your email can't help you search for emails or scan for malware
- PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Email)
  - historic (1990 - 1995), one-root PKI hierarchy
- PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)
  - ad hoc trust management
  - you decide which keys you trust for which users
- S/MIME (Secure MIME)
  - centralized certificate management
  - used by companies and governments
- see [Figure 8.12, page 235](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf) as an illustration of how mail transfer works
- see [Figure 8.13, page 236](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf) to show how security is added to plaintext email
- see [FIgure 8.14, page 237](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch8-rev1.pdf) for key distribution options
  - WhatsApp uses a centralized server
  - S/MIME uses a certificate model
- difficulties with email certificates
  - hard to map email addresses to people (and thus know who to trust)
  - need to handle revocation
- Proton Mail
  - web-based
  - exchanges PGP email between users on their system
  - allows you to choose a password to encrypt emails to non-Proton Mail users
  - no interoperability with other services using PGP except through manual addition of keys
