# Learning Rust 1

## Introductions

- introductions of two students

## Learning Rust, Sections 1 - 3

We are using [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
and [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

> Rust is all about memory safety.

### Cargo

Rust comes with `cargo` to build code and manage dependencies:

- `cargo new PROJECT`
- `cargo build`
- `cargo build --release`
- `cargo run`
- `cargo check`

### Mutability

You must declare variables to be
[mutable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability).
This doesn't work:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

This does:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

### Shadowing

You can
[shadow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing)
a variable by redeclaring it. Curly brackets create a new scope, and variable
declarations go away when they are out of scope. So the below code prints `12`
for the inner scope and `6` for the outer scope.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

### Namespaces

The `::` accesses elements of a namespace. `std` is the
[Rust standard libary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html), and is always
available through a `use` statement. `std::io` is the
[io module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html) of the standard lbrary.
The syntax `io::stdin()` accesses standard input in the `io` module.

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```

### Data types and integer overflow

Rust will
[infer data types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types)
where possible, but you must explicitly use type annotation where Rust cannot
infer. In the below example, the `guess` variables needs a type annotation
because `parse()` doesn't know what type it should be converting to.

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

Rust has:

- 8-bit to 128-bit signed and unsigned integers, e.g. `i16`, `u32`
- floating-point types, e.g. `f32`, `f64`
- boolean type, `bool`, which can be `true` or `false`
- character type, `char`

Rust also has

- tuples
- arrays

For
[integer overflow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-overflow),
Rust provides wrappers for:

- `wrapping_` -- wraps
- `checked_` -- returns None if overflow
- `overflowing` -- returns the value and True if overflow
- `saturating` -- caps at max or min value

### Return values

Rust will return the value of the last expression (leave off the semicolon!):

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

You can also use an explicit `return`.

### Exercises

At this point, you are ready to complete exercises for sections 0-3, plus the
first quiz.

## Learning Rust, Section 4

### Ownership

To preserve memory safety, Rust uses a set of
[ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#what-is-ownership)
rules.

> Each value in Rust has an owner.

> There can only be one owner at a time.

> When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

This is OK, because the variables are on the stack:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

There are two variables, and each have the value 5.

This is not OK, because Rust does not want two references to the same memory on
the heap:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

When `s1` and `s2` go out of scope, Rust would try to free the memory twice,
resulting in a
[double free](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory)
error.

So, to solve this problem, Rust declares that `s1` is no longer in scope. Thus
only `s2` is valid.

If your code really needs two pointers to two copies of the same string, use
`clone()`:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```

### Ownership and functions

When a value is passed to a function, its
[ownership is moved into the function](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#ownership-and-functions),
unless the type is one that can be copied. Types that can be copied: integers,
floats, booleans (true and false), and char.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                    // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still
                                    // use x afterward

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{some_string}");
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{some_integer}");
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

### Return values and scope

Rust functions can take ownership and
[return ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#return-values-and-scope).

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1

    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope

    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
  // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.

fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it

    let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope

    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function
}

// This function takes a String and returns one
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope

    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
}
```

Notice how you do not need to call a function to free memory! Scoping rules take
care of it for you.

### References

Use a
[reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing)
when you want to allow a function to use a variable without claiming ownership
of it. This is called _borrowing_.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

A reference is like a pointer, but _guaranteed_ to be valid.

A function cannot modify a reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    change(&s);
}

fn change(some_string: &String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

You can make a reference _mutable_:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
    some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

> If you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references
> to that value.

So this is not allowed:

```rust
 let mut s = String::from("hello");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
```

This prevents _data races_! The Rust book has a good definition of when data
races occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- There is no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

Rust will refuse to compile code with data races.

> At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of
> immutable references.

> References must always be valid.

### Exercises

At this point, you are ready to complete exercises for section 4, on primitive
types and section 6, on move semantics.

## Learning Rust, Section 5

### Structs

Structs let you define custom types:

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool,
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```

Here is how you initialize a struct:

```rust
fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        active: true,
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

See the book for additional details.

You can also
[define methods on structs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html#defining-methods)
using `impl`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}
```

You can also define
[associated functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html#associated-functions)
on structs. These are functions that don't take a struct, but return one.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}
```
