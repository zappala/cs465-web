# Denial of Service and address resolution attacks

## Questions on the readings

The readings today are from
[Computer Security and the Internet](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels.html),
[Chapter 11](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~paulv/toolsjewels/TJrev1/ch11-rev1.pdf),
sections 11.4 - 11.5.

## Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

- an attacker denies legitimate users access to a service by degrading
  performance or causing failure
  - _flooding attacks_ exhaust resources -- network bandwidth, CPU, memory, disk
    space
- motives

  - financial gain via extortion
  - commercial competitive gain by a competitor
  - activism
  - information warfare
  - hacker experimentation / ego boost
  - vengeance

- distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack

  - may use a botnet
  - may spoof source addresses

- historical examples: malformed packets can trigger implementation errors that
  terminate a process or crash the operating system

  - Ping of Death was a ping (ICMP echo request) sent as packet fragments whose
    total length exceeds the 65,535-byte maximum IP packet size -- crashed
    numerous TCP/IP stack implementations circa 1996 by overflowing allocated
    storage
  - Teardrop sent an IP packet in fragments with fragment offset fields set so
    that reassembly resulted in overlapping piecesâ€”crashing TCP/IP reassembly
    code in some implementations, exhausting resources in others
  - LAND sent a SYN packet with source address and port equal to destination
    address and port, crashing some implementations that sent responses to
    themselves repeatedly

- historical example: spoofing

  - SYN flooding is an attack where a client sends a SYN packet to open a TCP
    connection but never completes the connection. Older TCP implementations
    kept the connection in "half open" state in this case. If an attacker sent
    many SYN packets, they could fill this resource, causing the operating
    system to reject any subsequent TCP connections.
  - PING (ICMP echo request) flooding
  - UDP flooding
  - A _smurf flood_ sends a ping (ICMP echo request) to the broadcast address of
    a network. Listening hosts all send an ICMP echo reply. Can also be launched
    from a compromised host in a network. Note this is an _amplification_
    attack, which is particularly useful for an attacker.

- note that any Internet host can send any of these packets
- high impact, but easily fixed

## Defenses

- ingress filtering and egress filtering
  - e.g. drop packets sent to broadcast addresses
  - e.g. filter out packets not originating from accepted hosts

<Image alt="illustration of ingress and egress filtering" src={figure_11_6} />

- disabling unused services
- rate limiting of ICMP responses
- patching software that is vulnerable
- upstream filtering by ISPs protects against DoS attacks

## DNS attacks

- DNS translates host names into IP addresses

<Image alt="How DNS works" src={figure_11_7} />

- pharming attack -- falsifies name to address resolution
- attack vectors

  - local host file
  - tampering at intermediate servers
  - network-based response alteration

- DNS cache poisoning
  - queries sent with a random ID
  - a response should carry the same ID
  - an attacker who can guess an ID (e.g. if not properly randomized) can send a
    response to a cache, e.g. using a spoofed source address, and get the DNS
    cache to cache the bad response
- a general defense is DNSSEC, but its
  [deployment has been slow](https://stats.labs.apnic.net/dnssec)
  - see also
    [Verisign DNSSEC Scoreboard](https://www.verisign.com/en_US/company-information/verisign-labs/internet-security-tools/dnssec-scoreboard/index.xhtml)

## ARP attacks

- ARP spoofing

<Image alt="ARP Spoofing Attack" src={figure_11_8} />

- attack

  - false ARP replies that are cached
  - the problem is that replies are not authenticated

- defense
  - static, read-only tables
  - switches that inspect ARP responses and block suspicious ones
  - long-term it would be nice to improve ARP itself
