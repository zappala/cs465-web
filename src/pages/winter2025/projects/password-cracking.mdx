# Password Cracking

## Objectives

This is a practice project to help you learn C#. Your goal is to make a very
simple password cracking program. While you may think of password cracking as
something that an attacker does, this is actually a useful thing for a
legitimate website to do -- if your user's passwords are easily cracked, then
maybe an attacker will be able to get in easily!

## Project Setup

Follow the instructions
[in this short tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/get-started).
You should:

- Install Visual Studio Code if you haven't already.
- Install the `C# Dev Kit` extension.
- Create the Hello World app.

After you have done this, convert the Hello World app to be object-oriented:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello Again!");
    }
}
```

Practice both running and debugging the code.

## Project

Now write a simple password cracker. This program should:

- Load a file containing words in the dictionary
- Prompt the user for their password
- Check the password against every password in the dictionary, and print the
  password if it is found.
- Print "Not Found" if not found.

Be sure to create a new project for this, instead of re-using the hello world
projet.

To write this code, you may find the following resources helpful:

- [A tour of the C# language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/).

- [A dictionary of American English
  words](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/).
  You can use the file in `American/2of12.txt`.

- [Read the lines in a file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file.readalllines?view=net-8.0&source=recommendations).

- [Ask for user input](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.console.readline?view=net-8.0).

- [Import a cryptography library and use it to hash a word](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.sha256.hashdata?view=net-8.0).

- Since hashing uses a byte array,
  [convert a string into an array of bytes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.getbytes?view=net-8.0).

- [Compare two hashes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.sequenceequal?view=net-8.0).

If you would like to go farther, you may also want to try checking for common
substitutions that people use to disguise their password, such as:

- a -> @
- l -> 1
- e -> 3
