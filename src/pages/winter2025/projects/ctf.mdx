# CTF

## Objectives

In this project, you will be introduced to cybersecurity capture the flag (CTF)
competition-style challenges. This will become a valuable tool to gain
experience with ethical hacking after this course. In these CTF challenges, you
will be able to leverage all the vulnerabilities and attack vectors learned
throughout the course.

## Background

Capture the flag (CTF) competitions are the premier method for building and
demonstrating skills with software security. In general, there are two types of
CTF competitions:

1. _Jeopardy-style competitions._ These competitions involves participants
   solving self-contained challenge problems. These problems usually revolve
   around identifying a security flaw in the provided software, website,
   service, or data. Leveraging this flaw, participants will cause a security
   breach that provides them with a flag (usually a simple string). These flags
   are submitted to the CTF competition and participants are awarded points
   based on the difficulty of the challenge. The winner of the competition is
   the user or team who accumulates the largest number of points. These
   challenges are often grouped into categories and presented on a board similar
   to the game of Jeopardy (hence the name).
2. _Attack and defend competitions._ In these competitions, each team is
   provided with one or more software services that manage a teams flags. The
   goal of the competition is to break into other teams services to steal there
   flags, while properly hardening your team's services to avoid compromise.
   Points are awarded for (i) the uptime and correct operation of your team's
   services and (ii) the flags you stole from other teams. Points are deducted
   for the flags stolen from your services. The winner of the competition is the
   user or team who accumulates the largest number of points.

In this project, you are going to get experience with the challenges found in a
Jeopardy-style competition. Unfortunately, no appropriate CTF is running at this
time. Instead, we will be completing challenges from past picoCTF competitions.
picoCTF competitions are run by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and are aimed
at students. Past competition challenges have been collected into their picoGym
and this is where we will be completing challenges.

## Requirements

First, you must sign up for a picoCTF account and join our classroom:

1. Visit [https://play.picoctf.org/login](https://play.picoctf.org/login).
2. Sign up for an account. For FERPA compliance, you should pick a username that
   won't reveal who you are to other students. Don't use your netId.
3. Visit
   [https://play.picoctf.org/classrooms](https://play.picoctf.org/classrooms).
4. Click "Join a Classroom" and use the following code to join our classroom:
   `CL5v2ZfgH`.

You are now free to complete whatever challenges you want.

**You must not look up solutions for any of the challenges!** If you are caught
doing so, you will automatically receive a 0 on this project. picoGym has built
in functionality that will detect and report cheating.

## Grading Rubric

To complete this project, you must accumulate 2000 points. Up to 1000 points can
be used for extra credit.

**We have removed all rules about categories for points.**

Make sure you have registered for our classroom on picoCTF's website, otherwise
the TAs will not be able to check your points and you will receive no credit for
this exam.

## Submission

When you have completed this project, you will enter your username and the
number of points you believe you should receive on learningsuite.
