# PKI

## Objectives

In this project, you will gain first-hand experience examining Web PKI
certificates. You will also get to experience using cryptographic software.

**This experience may be quite frustrating. This isn't a bug with the project
but a feature.** When cryptographic software is not designed with humans in
mind, it can cause problems. The first step in learning to build better software
is to experience the current state of affairs.

## Requirements

In this project, you will gain experience with PKI on the Web and in Email. You
will write up your experience in a report that you will submit to Learningsuite. This
report will be composed of two parts, described below.

### Part 1—Investigating Web PKI Certificates

For this part of the project, you will be investigating the certificates for
several websites. To do so, I recommend using SSL Lab's
[SSL test tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/), though you are welcome to use
whatever tool you want.

Using your selected tool, retrieve and examine the certificates for the
following websites:

- google.com
- amazon.com
- utk.edu
- dhs.gov

For each of these websites, your report should describe the following
information:

- What is the subject of the leaf certificate?
- What is the issuer of the leaf certificate?
- What is its validity period?
- What type of public key is it using?
- What algorithm was used to sign the certificate?

You will also be examining several sites that have broken certificates:

- self-signed.badssl.com
- untrusted-root.badssl.com
- wrong.host.badssl.com
- expired.badssl.com

While the error for each is obvious (it is in the domain name), your report will
need to identify the flawed portion of the certificate in the `openssl` output.
Your report should also describe why the value you identified is flawed and what
the value should be in order to avoid an error. _To be clear, the text you are
looking for is not the line that starts with `Verification error:`, but inside
the actual certificate information._

### Part 2—Using an Email PKI Certificate

For this part of the project, you will create a S/MIME certificate and have that
certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). You are free to
choose whatever CA you wish and there are there are options you can (and should)
find that cost no money. Next, you will work with another student in the class
and use your certificates to send signed **and** encrypted email to each other. This is one place to get a free email certificate: [https://extrassl.actalis.it/portal/uapub/freemail?lang=en](https://extrassl.actalis.it/portal/uapub/freemail?lang=en)

As this project is intended to give you a real-world experience using
cryptographic software, how to complete this tasks is left to your discretion,
as it would be in the real-world. As such, you are free to use any online
resources and tools you want to complete this exercise. **Additionally, if after
three hours you have been unable to complete this assignment, you can stop at
that point.**

As you complete this part of the project, you will record the following
information in your report:

- The name of the student with which you (attempted to) exchanged secure email.
- What was the process for creating a certificate?
- What was the process for getting that certificate signed?
- What was the process for sharing a key between you and your partner?
- Include a screenshot of the signed and encrypted email you send and the email
  you received.
  - Identify where in the images you were able to verify the signature.
  - Identify where in the image you were able to confirm that encryption was
    used.
- Explain which parts of the process were difficult to understand or execute.
  - If you ultimately fail to send secure email after three hours, make sure
    this section is very detailed about what you attempted and why it failed.
- Rate your experience using the
  [System Usability Scale](https://usabilitygeek.com/how-to-use-the-system-usability-scale-sus-to-evaluate-the-usability-of-your-website/)
  . Give your answer for each question and compute your overall score.
- Now that you know about secure email technology, will you continue using it in
  the future? Why or why not?

In your report, as you answer these questions, make sure you identify any tools
that you used.

## Grading Rubric

- Part 1 (80 points)
  - 10 points for describing the required information for each of the valid
    certificates.
    - Two points for each item.
  - 10 points for identifying the error in each of the invalid certificates and
    describing how it would be fixed.
    - 5 points for identifying the problematic part of the certificate.
    - 5 points for describing how it would be fixed.
- Part 2 (100 points)
  - 10 points for identify the student you worked with.
  - 15 points for describing how you created a certificate.
  - 15 points for describing how you got the certificate signed.
  - 15 points for describing how you shared keys between you and your partner.
  - 15 points for the text and an image(s) showing the signed and encrypted
    message you sent and the one you received. The text should clearly identify
    where in the image you confirmed that the email was properly signed and
    encrypted.
  - 20 points for describing difficulties encountered during the process.
    - If you fail to send a signed and encrypted email, you can receive points
      for those above sections here by describing what approaches you tried, why
      they failed, and what you would try next.
  - 10 points for reporting your SUS ratings.
  - 10 points for answering the question regarding whether you will continue
    using secure email.

The TA may deduct up to 20% of your grade for poor writing quality. This penalty
will only be accessed if the writing is so poor as make it difficult for the TA
to read and understand the report. This penalty will not be used to punish minor
writing errors. If you run a grammar and spelling check, most students should
not need to worry about this penalty.

## Submission

Submit your report as a PDF file on Learningsuite.
