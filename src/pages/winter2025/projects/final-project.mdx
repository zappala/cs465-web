# Final Project

Spend two to three hours learning something new by trying additional CTF
challenges. You can use material on [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) or
[picoCTF](https://picoctf.org) or [RingZer0][https://ringzer0ctf.com/].
For example, on pwn.college, look at topics such
as
[reverse engineering](https://pwn.college/program-security/reverse-engineering/),
[shellcode injection](https://pwn.college/program-security/shellcode-injection/),
or [kernel security](https://pwn.college/system-security/kernel-security/).
Alternatively, you'll find a wide variety of easy, medium, and hard challenges
on PicoCTF.

As a reminder from the first day of the course, I mentioned that if you submit a writeup
to RingZer0, and they approve the writeup AND you get a 'special mention' on your writeup
from them, you'll get a full-letter grade bump in the class.  Note that it takes them several 
to review writeups, so submitting them as early as possible is probably a good idea.  Once 
you solve a challenge there, then you can read other people's writeups for that challenge.
Submitting writeups ALSO gets you "coins" that you can spend on hints for other challenges.

Explaining in detail, in writing, how you solved the challenge is good practice for technical
writing, and reviewing your own writeups is a great way to refresh your memory about a topic.
Good luck!
 

## Deliverables

Turn in:

- Screenshots of your progress after 3 hours
- One or two paragraphs explaining what you have learned (take an additional 10
  to 15 minutes to write this)
- One paragraph explaining the impact of this class on your future career (take
  5 minutes to write this)
