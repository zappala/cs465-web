# Service

[Disciple-scholars](https://speeches.byu.edu/topics/discipleship/) seamlessly
blends discipleship with scholarship to serve God's children.

Spend 30 to 60 minutes performing some kind of service that is related to
security or privacy. For example, you could help a friend audit their personal
password habits, use a password manager, or set up 2FA on important accounts.
You could teach a student who has not taken CS 465 about some element of
security, or help a friend who is new to security try a capture-the-flag
challenge.

Write a paragraph explaining what you did and how this contributed to your
understanding of disciple-scholarship.
