# Homework: Certificates and TLS

For this homework, you're going to examine certificates and TLS settings.

## Part 1: Certificates

Use your web browser to inspect the certificates for _two_ websites of your
choice. You can inspect the certificate in Chrome by clicking on the settings
icon directly to the left of the website name in the URL bar.

For each website, list the following:

- for each certificate in the certificate chain
  - name of the organization given in the `Certificate Hierarchy`
  - validity period (starting date, ending date) and calculate the total time
    (in years and months)
  - public key algorithm
  - certificate key usage
  - certificate key basic constraints

## Part 2: TLS

For this part of the project, you will be investigating TLS settings using SSL
Lab's [SSL test tool](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). Use this tool to
examine _two_ websites of your choice. For each website, report:

- overall grade
- any flaws detected
- supported TLS protocols
- supported TLS cipher suites

See if you can find a website with less than an A grade!

### Extra Credit - Non-HTTP service check

3 points of extra credit if you use [testssl](https://testssl.sh)  to examine at least one non-http tls service.  Include as much of the same detail for this service as you do for the rest of Part 2 examined websites.

## Grading

Homework is graded on a participation basis. Turn in a PDF of your report.
