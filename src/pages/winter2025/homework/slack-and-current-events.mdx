# Homework: Slack Setup and Current Events

For this homework, you're going to Join the class slack channel. You'll also be looking for computer security related real-world events and discussing them.

## Join Slack

Join the class slack channel.  Use your name so that we can match you up with class roles.  This will get you access to help from the TAs and Professor Clift.

Here is [a Slack invitation](https://join.slack.com/t/byucs465winter2025/shared_invite/zt-2x89o5fl3-8Z57YpCqaGAzUeh94m0OjQ)


## Security-related news stories

Security-related news stories happen almost daily on topics that are relevant to this course. I encourage you to watch for news stories in the popular and technical press that relate to topics we discuss in class and other security topics.

Assignment: During the semester, share at least one news article on a security-related news story to the class slack group in the news section. This should include the following:

    A link to the story
    A summary of the story in your own words
    Your opinion about the significance of the story and some commentary

Submit the URL of your post to Learning Suite for Homework 1 so the TA will be sure to give you credit.

Do not re-post a story that has already been posted.

Post according to the following schedule, based on the first letter of your last name, so that we have stories posted throughout the semester.

A-F (Jan) G-P (Feb) Q-Z (Mar)

I encourage you to comment on other students' submissions.

## Grading

Homework is graded on a participation basis. 

## Pay attention to the #news channel on slack periodically

I'll be regularly posting interesting news articles I find to the same channel.  Details of what you read there might show up as extra credit on some future exam.
