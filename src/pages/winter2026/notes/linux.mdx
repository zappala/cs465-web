# Linux

## Introductions

- introductions of two to three students

## Options for running Linux

1. You already run Linux on an x86 machine. You should be set. :-)

1. You have a Windows machine running on an x86 chip. You can easily setup a VM
   using VMWare, VirtualBox, or a few other solutions. We Recommend you use a
   [pre-built virtual machine](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
   but you can likely use Ubuntu or another distribution just fine.

1. You have a Mac running Apple silicon. We recommend using a VPS provider in
   this case. You can use AWS if you like, I prefer the simplicity of Digital
   Ocean. You can setup a basic Ubuntu machine or you can see
   [instructions for running Kali on Digital Ocean](https://www.kali.org/docs/cloud/digitalocean/).

## Learning Linux

We will use the
[Linux Practice](https://cs465.zappala.org/winter2026/homework/linux-practice/)
homework to show you how to get started with Linux.
