# Introduction

## Syllabus

- Introductions -- Professor Clift will introduce himself, perhaps we'll do 2-3 student
  introductions each day of class
- [Review the syllabus](/fall2026/syllabus)

## Security and Privacy

- Computer security involves protecting computer-related assets from
  unauthorized actions and their consequences, which includes:

  - prevention of unauthorized actions
  - detecting unauthorized actions
  - mitigating effects of attacks when they (inevitably) occur
  - recovery from attacks

- Cybersecurity is often used interchangeably with computer security. Often
  cybersecurity is IT-focused and relates to protecting network-connected
  assets, identifying break-ins, and recovering from break-ins. Computer
  security is used more often in a CS/academic context. It often encompasses a
  broader range of activities, such as developing secure software, finding and
  patching software vulnerabilities, reverse engineering code, developing new
  forms of cryptography and new applications of cryptography.

- Privacy refers to protecting personally sensitive information and controlling
  how it is shared. This affects any application that collects personal data
  (e.g. health information, email, facial recognition, phone location, browser
  history). It also has numerous social impacts, such as ads tracking you
  online, police departments purchasing your phone location, mass surveillance
  with cameras and facial recognition, etc. As a result there are a variety of
  attempts to create privacy legislation, such as GDPR and the California
  Conusmer Privacy Act. Simultaenously, several nations are advocating for laws
  that provide governments a "backdoor" to decrypt any encrypted communications,
  such as WhatsApp messages.

- Computer security and privacy are often intertwined and hard to distinguish.
  For example, if I use software that encrypts my email so that nobody can read
  it except me and my friend, does that mean I'm focused on security (preventing
  an adversary from reading my emails) or privacy (preventing Google from
  reading my email to use it for ads or AI training)?

- Computers and cryptography can be used to provide guarantees and assurances.
  For example, if I digitally sign a contract, evidence of that signature can 
  be used in legal contexts to compel me to do what I agreed to, also known as 
  "non-repudiation." Similarly, we could design systems that guarantee anonymity 
  for feedback providers or whistleblowers, or for people evading oppressive governments.

- A `security mindset` requires thinking carefully about security throughout a
  software project you are working on

## Discussion

- Fill out an index card:

  - Name
  - Expected graduation month/year
  - Career goals
  - What is one thing you need me to know about you?
  - What are your expectations for this class?

- Group discussion

  - How has computer security affected your life so far?
  - How will computer security affect your life in the future?
  - Is there any way in which you wish you had more privacy online?
