  Hello! CS 465 continues to evolve -- we're fine-tuning some assignments this
  year.

  I dont have an assigned office. You can find me on slack, most of the time.
  If we need to meet I can reserve a space for us.  Please contact me to
  schedule an appoitnment. You can call or text me during normal hours at
  (utah's primary areacode) 376-0305  - slack is better most of the time though
